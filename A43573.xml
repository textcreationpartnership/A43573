            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE power of Godlineſs is much ſpoken of, but (I am afraid) very rarely to be found amongſt [even] famous profeſſors: Moſt content themſelves with external viſible duties, which Formaliſts may carry on with as much ſeeming zeal and applauſe as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere worſhippers: A formal ſpirit is the diſeaſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day: The beams of Goſpel-light, in the late noon-tyde-diſpenſations, have ſo far extracted an aſſent to fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal truths, and the neceſſity of ſome practical duties, that 'tis a ſhame in ſome places not to have a form of Godlineſs: Many will be found Orthodox in their judgments, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally conformable in their practiſes; yet without a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Grace in their hearts, or the life of Religion in their lives, in the day of accounts; witneſs the fooliſh Virgins. Thouſands do finally miſcarry beſides the groſly prophane: Some go to hell with a candle in their hands, Chriſt's Colours in their hats, his Word in their mouths, and in the habit of Religion: Every one is not a Saint, that looks like one; a painted picture makes a fair ſhew, but wants life: A Formaliſt will be comely indeed, if animated with the truth of grace: But the leaven of hypocriſe ſpoyls many good duties: This was that leaven of the Phariſees that ſowred their prayers, and rendred them diſtaſtful to
<pb facs="tcp:40964:3"/> God: They made Religious duties a ſtage to act vain glory upon, their Prayers had a thick ſhell and little kernel. Our Saviour would not have the Saints like them, Chriſts Diſciples muſt do ſome ſingular thing, more than others; Their righteouſneſs muſt go beyond that of the Scribes and Phariſees: Sincerity is that ſpirit and life that is to run through Religion: elſe it is a Body without a Soul, or Cloaths without the Man: This is the chief drift of our Saviours teaching, and main deſign of Goſpel-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, to render Profeſſors ſincere and ſpiritual, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their hearts to God in Evangelical performances. I have many times bewailed the condition of thoſe who are very buſie in Externals of Religion abroad, and are groſly negligent of the main Eſſentials at home. They are like thoſe who are propping up ſome remote members of their body, while their Vitals are waſting in a languiſhing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: Theſe are like a Man in a Feaver, his face and hands burn, but his heart ſhakes and quivers for cold: Theſe I may call Pepper-profeſſors, hot in the mouth, but cold at the ſtomack: There are thouſands in the World will run many miles to hear a Sermon, will countenance the beſt Preachers, will read the Scriptures and good Books, will pray in their families, yea keep days of Faſting and Prayer with others, that yet will not ſet about heart-work and fleſh-diſpleaſing duties, of mortifying beloved luſts, loving, forgiving and praying for enemies, — yea that will not ſet themſelves ſolemnly to the duties of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, Self-examination, and ſecret Prayer: The Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel will not ſtir except the wind of applauſe blow the ſails; theſe are like the Nightingale in the wood, of which it is recorded, that ſhe ſings moſt ſweetly when ſhe thinks any is near her. An Hypocrite can pray beſt, when taken notice of by men, you ſhall ſeldom ſee him at work with his heart in a Cloſet: he is of the mind of thoſe carnal perſons of Chriſts natural kindred, <hi>Joh. 7.4.</hi> who ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>If thou do theſe things ſhew thy ſelf to the World, for,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40964:3"/> ſaith the Text, <hi>ver. 5. Neither did his brethren believe in him: q. d.</hi> Such as carry on duties, or counſel others to ſuch undertakings as may expoſe them to publick view for oſtentation, declare plainly they want true grace, which makes perſons Jews inwardly, <hi>Whoſe circumciſion is of the heart, in the Spirit, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God:</hi> Rom. <hi>2.29. The main trade of a</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, is his Home-trade, as one ſaith,<note place="margin">Jurnal Chriſtian Armour, Chap. 12. Sect. 3. p. 304.</note> which is ſpent in ſecret betwixt God and his own ſoul: here he drives an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Trade, he is at Heaven and home again, richly laden in his thoughts with heavenly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations before the World knows where he hath been.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of theſe things hath ingaged me to ſpend ſome thoughts, concerning this great and much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Duty of Cloſet Prayer; which when I had delivered, and ſeveral had got Copies thereof, it was judged fit for the Preſs, ſome hopes conceived of its further uſefulneſs: I peruſed it again, and methodized it into this form, and communicated my thoughts to ſome concerning the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. A friend gave me notice there was a Book ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant upon the ſame Subject, which I enquired after, and found one of Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> on the ſame Text: That Book I look'd over, and was ready to think it would ſave me a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but, upon ſecond thoughts, I conſidered that this might fall into ſome hands that that would not; that ſeveral men writing on the ſame Subject may be uſeful, is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that our Method and moſt of our Matter is different; for I had finiſh'd mine before I ſaw the other, except two or three leaves in the cloſe: Beſides that, the other is larger, this a ſmall Piece, and more portable, as a pocket-book, or <hi>Vade mecum:</hi> let it be then a ſhort Appendix to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Piece.</p>
            <p>I am heartily glad, any of Gods ſervants have ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to promote this part of practical piety; 'tis an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deſign, and I am well aſſu<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, if Chriſtians were more
<pb facs="tcp:40964:4"/> in their Cloſets with God, their own ſouls would thrive better, and things would ſucceed better abroad; Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> being ſilenced from publick work; deſired his Hearers to ſpend that time they were want to come to his Lecture in, in ſerious Prayer and Meditation in their Cloſets, and he was confident Satan would be a loſer, and their ſouls gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by that providence: And this I can affirm, that if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would ſpend part of that time in ſecret Prayer they take to run abroad to Sermons in, they would be better proficients: Not but that hearing the word is neceſſary and ſo is this; nor muſt the one juſtle out the other: yea, theſe ſecret duties help us to profit by publick Ordinances. If dung be poured down on heaps in the field, it doth no good; it muſt be ſpread abroad, before it make fruitful ground. The plaiſter heals not, except it be applyed; ſo the Word muſt be ſpread on our hearts by ſerious and ſecret Meditation and Application, or elſe it will never make our ſouls healthful and fruitful; and then we muſt pray over it, for the ſhowers of divine grace to waſh it and work it into our hearts: Many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are loſt for want of ſouls taking them home to their Cloſets, and turning them to Prayer: I fear all will be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enough that Miniſters can preach or write upon this theam, I doubt ſtill, this work will be either totally neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected or negligently performed: its an hard work; the ſpirit muſt travel in it; and (ſaith good Mr. <hi>Bains</hi>) the Saints can indure better to hear an hour, than to pray a quarter: yea our trifling hearts will make any excuſe to ſhift from this duty, or ſhuffle it off; nay, though it be in exchange for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a ſign the work is of God, and tending much to the ſouls good, or elſe Satan and our corrupt hearts would never ſo much hinder or oppoſe it.</p>

Oh Chriſtian, the time may come, or is already, when men may ſtop thy mouth, and will not ſuffer thee to witneſs a good confeſſion, withdraw thy ſelf from men, and retire unto thy God, who will make thee freely welcom, to pour out thy ſoul to him in ſecret.

Only ſee thou beeſt a Child of God. Naturaliſts tell of a precious Stone of an excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue yet loſeth all its efficacy when 'tis put into a dead mans mouth: ſo Prayer in the lips of a Saint or a righteous man, availeth much, but the Prayer of the wicked is not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, but abominable to God: See to your ſtates, and then ſee that you pray aright, for manner, matter, end, many ask
<pb facs="tcp:40964:5"/> and receive not, becauſe they ask amiſs: Above all, Soul, in thy ſecret addreſſes to God, take heed of a trifling ſpirit; thou'lt find moſt ado with thy ſelf herein: our wanton ſpirits are loath to be pent up in the narrow room of a ſpiritual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; we love to take our liberty in ranging abroad to a thouſand objects: but Chriſtian, as thou loveſt thy peace, thy Soul, thy God, look to thy ſpirit in ſecret Prayer: Do not tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle away thy time upon thy knees, let not thy words freeze as they come from thee, let no diſcouragements beat thee off: the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as one ſaith, takes the Bullets that Chriſt ſhot at her, and with an humble boldneſs of faith, ſends them back again in Prayer; which indeed reach'd his heart, and prevailed with God for mercy.</p>
            <p>But, I ſhall inlarge no more at preſent, but refer thee to this ſmall Treatiſe, wherewith I have (according to my poor talent) laid before thee this great duty: What effect it ſhall have I know not, my God knows, in whoſe hands the bleſſing of our endeavours lyes; Get alone and pray over this Book, and for the unworthy ſinful Author, as he deſires to do for thee into whoſe hand this may come: let our Prayers daily meet at the throne of Grace, till our ſouls meet before the throne of God; if thou receiveſt any good by this or any other work this poor worm hath handed to thee, aſcribe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the inſtrument, but all to the agent, and efficient: our good God, from whom comes every good and perfect gift, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains not the work for the plainneſs of the ſtile; it was purpoſely put in this dreſs for the vulgars benefit; and if it or my ſelf be expoſed to cenſure for that, 'tis welcom. I write not to pleaſe learned Scholars, but to profit plain Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; whoſe ſpiritual good I prefer above any credit to my ſelf. I am ſure, there is none due: there being few of my brethren but they tranſcend me in parts and learning, <hi>But by the grace of God I am what I am, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>15.10.</hi> Nor is that grace altogether in vain: for as it hath helped me in labours ſo he hath in ſome meaſure bleſſed my labours, though I be nothing, the leaſt of Saints, not meet to be called a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.
<pb facs="tcp:40964:5"/> Did thoſe that read my labours know me, they would be ready to deſpiſe my undertakings: this I ſpeak, becauſe my former book hath found ſuch good acceptance, and this is ſo much deſired. And that no man think of me, above what he knoweth to be in me: my heart hath been near fainting through diſcouragements from my great weakneſs, had I not been ſupported many a time with that word, in <hi>2 Cor. 4.7. But we have this treaſure in earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the Power may be of God, and not of Man.</hi> Whence I gather, that God can make uſe of weak, unlearned, ſinful inſtruments to do great works; and he can uſe perſons of mean abilities, to accompliſh his glorious ends, in converting ſouls, as well as the profoundeſt Clerks, or wiſeſt men on earth: yea ſometimes be layeth aſide theſe, and rather uſeth the former, that all the glory might be his, <hi>And that no fleſh might glory in his preſence: 1 Cor. 1.29.</hi> But ſuch as I am or have, is all devoted to the honour of our Redeemer, and welfare of Souls.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40964:10"/> were two material deſtructive Faults which the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were guilty of; in that ſweet and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Ordinance: Thoſe were, 1. <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> 2. <hi>Batto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> or vain-babling. Jeſus Chriſt rebukes and rectifies both.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They were wont to perform their private devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in publick places, meerly for vain-glory, to be ſeen of men, as in the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> or in the <hi>Streets: ver.</hi> 5. Now for the Diſciples practice in this caſe, he commands them to withdraw themſelves out of the view of men, into ſome ſolitary place, and there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that Duty, where they are leaſt expoſed to the danger of oſtentation: <hi>ver.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another fault that our Redeemer rebukes in the Duty of Prayer is, vain Repetitions. And though he only mention it here as the Heathens fault, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. yet certainly the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> might alſo be guilty of it, for they are cenſured for their long Prayers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14. Yet upon different accounts. Here the Heathens uſe vain repetitions that they may move God: There the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> make long Prayers that they may deceive men, and devour Widows houſes. This Text ſaith, <hi>They think they ſhall be heard for their much ſpeaking;</hi> juſt as <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.26. They called on the name of <hi>Baal</hi> from morning even till noon, ſaying, O <hi>Baal</hi> hear us; they leapt upon the Altar, and cryed aloud, and cut themſelves, with knives and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, till the blood guſhed out upon them. No doubt this was done to move their cruel god (or rather ſtupid block) to ſome pity and compaſſion: Juſt as the frantick <hi>Papiſts</hi> do at this day in their ſelf-tormenting penances: But our God who is the ſearcher of hearts, delights more in ardent affections, than in either extenſion of the voice, or multiplication of words, or excruciating afflictions of the outward man: Therefore our Saviour tells us, that when we pray, we come not to inform
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40964:10"/> God of any thing he is ignorant of, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him:</hi> But we pray that our own hearts may be affected, and that we may have the condition of acceptance: And for the rectifying of this abuſe of vain babling in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Chriſt propounds and preſents to us an exact draught and compendious platform of Prayer, in that which is commonly called, <hi>The Lords Prayer:</hi> not as though men ſhould ſay only thoſe words and no more; for then the Apoſtles had failed in praying in other terms, but that this might be a directory for Prayer. So that every thing we ask,<note place="margin">Ut aliter orare quam docuit, non Ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia ſola eſt, ſed &amp; Culpa: Cyp. ſerm. ad orat. Domin. pag. <hi>408.</hi>
                     </note> ſhould be reducible to ſome of thoſe heads mentioned in this perfect platform: So that, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, To pray otherwayes than he hath taught (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to the manner, or ſubſtance of the matter) 'tis not only ignorance but an offence: and indeed we cannot expect to be heard except we ask, as well according to Chriſts mind as in his name. But this is not the ſubject I have choſen to inſiſt upon. That which falls under our preſent cognizance from this Text, is, The modification of Prayer, with reſpect to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of privacy, ſolitarineſs, or retirement.</p>

Beſides, that is not ſuitable to the ſcope of the place, which oppoſeth ſelf-retirement to the Phariſaical modes of devotion:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Leigh.</hi> in Crit.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Shut thy door:</hi> this word imports yet a further degree of ſecrecy: <hi>q. d.</hi> That thou maiſt make thy ſelf to be leſs obſerved, ſhut up thy ſelf in a room; let none come at thee to diſturb thee in thy converſings with God, bar the door, and make it faſt: yea let none over-hear
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40964:11"/> thee in thy retired devotions. For, obſerve it, in true Cloſet-Prayer there ſhould be an including of the voice as well as the body: ſome pray ſo loud in their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that they may be heard into the ſtreets; this is not properly Cloſet-Prayer, ſince it doth not attain the end of this retirement, which is an approving the heart on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God, and avoiding all ſhews and occaſions of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and vain-glory; for it is all one (as to this end) whether the body be ſeen or the voice be heard: Only remember, this is ſpoken of ſecret Prayer; for it doth not exclude publick Prayer in a congregation, where the body is ſeen, and voice is heard: Yet it doth by a kind of Synecdoche require ſelf-denial, ſingleneſs, and ſincerity in all kind of Prayer,<note place="margin">Unae ſpecie ſimplicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis pro toto genere poſita.</note> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, private, ſecret, for one part or ſign of uprightneſs in the duty is put for the whole, ſhutting the door, for integrity of heart in the whole management of this great Affair.</p>

Come then, and fear not, poor Diſciple of Chriſt, come with filial affections, and the Spirit of Adoption, and thou art ſure to ſpeed: for this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40964:12"/> paternal relation imports affection, proviſion, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention, and compaſſion. If thou wilt be a Child to him; he will be a Father to thee: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Here's the Arguments and incouragements to this duty of ſecret Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Thy Father ſees in ſecret.</hi> All's one to him whether you be in a publick Church, or private Cloſet; God (whoſe eyes are ten thouſand times brighter than the Sun) ſees you in the one place, as well as in the other, and though men ſee you not, yet content your ſelves with this. That God and your conſciences are competent wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of your uprightneſs; with whom you have to do, and from whom you have your reward.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He will reward thee openly.</hi> There's two things in this expreſſion. 1. They ſhall be <hi>rewarded,</hi> 2. They ſhall be <hi>openly rewarded.</hi> So that men ſhall ſay, Verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.11. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> do all their works to be ſeen of men, and of men they have that ſorry reward: you do yours in the ſight of God, and from him you ſhall receive your abundant and eternal recompence. Though men ſee you not, fear not, you ſhall be ſeen and accepted by him that ſearcheth hearts, and knoweth the mind of his ſpirit: But of theſe, more anon.</p>
                  <p>The ſum and deſign of the Text is this. Thou, my Diſciple, ſeeſt the plauſible practices of thy hypocritical <hi>Phariſees,</hi> to gain credit and applauſe; they perform their private duties in publick places, as Markets and Synagogues, that they may paſs among men for eminent Saints; and they are generally ſo eſteemed; that's their reward. But thou that haſt given up thy name to me, in the profeſſion of my Name, take my counſel for regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating this ſweet Duty of ſecret Prayer: Let none ſee what thou goeſt about, ſteal time from all obſervers, withdraw thy ſelf into ſome Cloſet or private place;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40964:12"/> and when thou haſt made all faſt, do thou ſet thy ſelf in the preſence of God, approve thy heart to him, lay open thy boſom before him, tell him all thy grievances; and though no creature is privy to thy ſecret groans, yet be ſure that all thy deſires are before God, and thy groaning is not hid from him, and he takes notice of thy tears; and reſerves them in a bottle by him, to be rewarded in a viſible manner in a ſeaſonable time, thy labour is not in vain, thy work is with the Lord, and thy reward with thy God.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. III.</hi> Doctrines raiſed, and cleared.</head>
                  <p>THere are many Doctrines lye couched in the words, I ſhall but hint them, and pitch upon one:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Prayer is a choice part of religion;</hi> its a piece of natural worſhip; though the right ordering of it is by inſtitution, yet 'tis a main part of Religion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore often put in Scripture for the whole ſervice of God: <hi>He that calls on the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved, Rom.</hi> 10.13. A prayerleſs ſoul, is graceleſs:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Prayer is a duty much abuſed:</hi> There's ſcarce any thing ſo much perverted and corrupted as this choice duty, by formality, hypocriſie, ſuperſtition, baſe and by-ends, as is clear by theſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> many wayes, and their younger brethren the <hi>Papiſts</hi> at this day, <hi>Maſſes, Dirges, Invocation of Saints,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>There are ſeveral ſorts of Prayer:</hi> Both as to the kinds, modes, and circumſtances. The Apoſtle diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth of Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. There's alſo Publick-Prayer, Family-Prayer, and Cloſet-Prayer. Now a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40964:13"/> Chriſtian muſt pray with all Prayer and Supplication: <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. The laſt, is here inſiſted on.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>A Chriſtian muſt do nothing for praiſe or applauſe,</hi> eſpecially in matters of Religion: It is a baſe proſtituting the higheſt things of God, to our beaſtly luſts. It is to feed an humour, and damn the ſoul with that which ſhould ſave it. Let no Chriſtians, (as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> here,) make Prayer truckle to their credit, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done through ſtrife or vain-glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>There are ſet and ſtated times of Prayer:</hi> This is hinted in this word, <hi>When,</hi> when thou prayeſt. A time there muſt be for it, though the point of time is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, yet a time muſt be ſet apart for the duty, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day; a Chriſtian muſt chuſe out the fitteſt time for the duty, by the due uſe of his liberty and diſcretion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Circumſtances are of great uſe in all our actions: The ſtreets are proper places to walk, talk, buy and ſell in, but not ſo fit for Prayer; the Church is a fit place for publick devotion, not ſo for a ſolemn performance of the duty of ſecret Prayer. Although mental ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are fit enough in both, yet it's not convenient to kneel down or uſe outward geſtures of ſecret Prayer there.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Cloſet-Prayer muſt be with all ſecrecy and ſolitarineſs:</hi> In a Cloſet, door ſhut: As we muſt not blow a Trumpet when we give Alms, ſo we muſt not hold out a flag when we go to wait on God in the Duty of Prayer: It was carnal counſel the brethren of Chriſt gave him: <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Shew thy ſelf to the World.</hi> The reaſon is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>For neither did his brethren believe in him:</hi> A ſad ſign of carnality!</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>God alone is the proper object of our Prayers:</hi> pray to thy Father. As he is the object of our Faith, ſo of Prayer: For he alone can help, therefore he is to be ſought, none elſe ſees our ſtate, or can ſatisfie ſouls:

                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.16. <hi>Doubtleſs thou art our Father, though</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>be ignorant of us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. In all our addreſſes to God we muſt own God as our Father; as having adopted us in Chriſt: becauſe his, therefore ours: <hi>I aſcend</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to my Father and your Father, Joh.</hi> 20.17. Indeed by nature we were children of wrath, but by grace children of his Love; ſo that they may ſay, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.8. <hi>But now, O Lord, thou art our Father.</hi> Oh plead and improve this relation.</p>

                  <p n="14">14. <hi>A Chriſtians reward is from God:</hi> Thy Father will reward thee: Not men. <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> have their reward from men, from men they expect it: Saints ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their reward from God, and God gives it them: Men reward them evil for their good will, and they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no better: If better come from men, they own it as a gratuity ſent from their Father: It's a principle of Religion to know and <hi>believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him, Heb.</hi> 11.6.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Abraham,</hi> The friend of God, and Father of the faithful, converſed much with his God alone; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in this duty of Prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.22.

The <hi>Chaldee</hi> tranſlates it by praying, but the <hi>Greek</hi> by exerciſing himſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> both in meditation and prayer: And truly there is a near affinity betwixt theſe two ſweet duties, and 'tis uſual for a devout ſoul to fall out of the one into the other, in its retirements. <hi>Soliloquie</hi> in the heart helps to a <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie</hi> with God:<note place="margin">Locus precibus ubi<expan>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40964:15"/> and at this time more earneſtly for the happy ſucceſs of his ſervant; a ſingular example of piety: A place it was every way fit for prayer, eſpecially in ſolitude where the ſenſes are leſs drawn off from pious meditations: Some think he was returning from his devotions, and then 'tis worth noting, What a ſpeedy reward of his piety, and effect of his prayers was granted: Would all young men take the like courſe for a Wife, they might meet ſeaſonably with a <hi>Rebeckah</hi> in mercy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Jacob</hi> is a famous inſtance of this choice exerciſe, few like him; he was put to flee, but they could not drive him from his God: They had their meeting-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and intercourſe where none ſaw: particularly that remarkable time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. <hi>Jacob was left alone: And there wreſtled a man with him, until the breaking of the day.</hi> 'Tis likely <hi>Jacob</hi> had ſent his houſhold away on purpoſe, that he might wreſtle with God alone: I ſhall not diſpute whether <hi>Jacob</hi> had any extraordinary natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtrength of body, I am ſure he had abundance of ſpiritual ſtrength of grace, nor ſhall I take notice of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſubtil diſputes concerning this man. <hi>Hoſea</hi> tells us, it was an Angel, yet withal he tells us, <hi>That by his ſtrength he had power with God, Hoſ.</hi> 12.3, 4.

It was God himſelf, <hi>Elohim,</hi> whom <hi>Jacob</hi> overcame in this ſtupendious [<hi>monomachia,</hi> or] conflict. But how did he thus prevail? The Text ſaith, with prayers and tears, he wept and made ſupplication: Now he had gotten God to a ſide (as it were) and none came to diſtract him, or to part this ſtrong and bleſſed duel; he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſtick to his hold, and not let God go, till he bleſſed him: And good <hi>Jacob</hi> came off a Noble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror; and from that purchaſed the famous name of

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a choice man of God, whom the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture characterizeth as a <hi>non-ſuch, Deut.</hi> 34.10. <hi>There aroſe not a Prophet ſince in</hi> Iſrael <hi>like unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>whom the Lord knew face to face:</hi> And this intimate acquaintance was obtained, maintained, and exerciſed by this ſecret converſing with God: How often do we find the Lord and his ſervant <hi>Moſes</hi> together?

A ſtrange Scripture, God and <hi>Moſes</hi> had been converſing with each other in the mount fourty dayes: God tells <hi>Moſes,</hi> the people had made them a molten calf, and he was angry and would conſume them, and bids <hi>Moſes</hi> let him alone, as though <hi>Moſes</hi> had bound the hands of omnipotency: Nay then, thinks <hi>Moſes,</hi> if my poor people be in this hazard ſince I am with God, I'le ply the throne of grace, and improve my intereſt for them: and then he falls cloſs to the work, and beſought the Lord his God and ſaid—At this time he alone ſtood in the gap,<note place="margin">Pſal. 106.25.</note> and prevailed by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion to turn away Gods wrath from <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Here was a work, and this was the fruit of ſecret prayer.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>David</hi> the man after Gods own heart, was a man much skilled in ſecret or cloſet meditations and prayers: Hence ſome of his Pſalms of Prayer and Praiſe were firſt compoſed in Caves, Wilderneſſes, and ſolitary places, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. Title, <hi>is Maſchil of David; a Prayer when he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40964:16"/> was in the Cave.</hi> And this is for inſtruction to us, ſo <hi>Maſchil</hi> ſignifies: Yea he purpoſely compiles the 102. <hi>Pſal.</hi> as a pattern to all that may be in his caſe, that is ſolitary, <hi>As a Pelican in the Wilderneſs, an owl in the deſart, or a ſparrow alone upon the houſe top, v.</hi> 6, 7. Then they are to pray as he did, and to pour out their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint before the Lord: Yea, upon a declaration of Gods covenant, deſigns of mercy to <hi>David</hi> and his houſe; the good man went either into ſome private room in his own houſe, or into the Tent before the Ark, and there ſet himſelf, firſt to meditate, then to pray; for he did both, as that Scripture clearly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.17, 27. And oh what memorable fruits of ſecret Prayer had <hi>David</hi> frequently? Surely he felt the ſweetneſs of it, both in his ſoul and body, in his ſpiritual eſtate, and political affairs: Therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it to all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>Commune with your own heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your bed</hi> (or in your bed-chamber) and there alſo offer the ſacrifices of righteouſneſs, <hi>And put your truſt in the Lord, ver.</hi> 4.5.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. ANother example from Scripture of the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this duty of ſecret prayer, is, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous man of God <hi>Elijah,</hi> who wrought many miracles, and was mighty in prayer, for ſo the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies of him, Chap. 5 17, 18. that he could ſhut and open Heaven; he had (as it were) got the Key of the Clouds, to open the windows of Heaven, that it might rain or not rain, according to his word. But how came he by this power? Why, certainly he had great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with his God in ſecret. Take one inſtance
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40964:17"/> what his practice was, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.19. to <hi>ver.</hi> 24. It is the memorable Hiſtory of raiſing the Widow womans dead Son. It was a great undertaking: none but God could raiſe the dead, God is to be implored by earneſt Prayer, no place ſo fit for that great duty as a Cloſet, or ſome cloſs Chamber, therefore he being to deal with his God in good hard earneſt about this important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſaith the Text, <hi>He carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed, and then he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lord, ver.</hi> 19, 20. It was not the firſt time <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> had there wreſtled with God; if it was his lodging room, it was his praying room: And here God heard him, and wrought the miracle: what he did for <hi>Elijah,</hi> he can and will do for us, if he ſee fit: for <hi>Elijah</hi> was no more than a man, and ſubject to like paſſions as we are.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is a remarkable Inſtance he was a Prophet of the Lord, ſanctified from his Mothers womb, yet he met with ſo many diſcouragements, that he hath a mind to leave his people;<note place="margin">Jer. 9.1, 2.</note> and he wiſheth for a lodging-place in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſome ſolitary retirement, that there he might take his fill of weeping; however he reſolves at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that wherever he is, he will get retired, and, ſaith he, <hi>My ſoul ſhall weep in ſecret places for your pride, Jer.</hi> 13.17. Yet more punctually, to the buſineſs of ſecret Prayer, ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.17. Saith he, <hi>I ſate alone becauſe of thy hand.</hi> But what did he alone? Did he only pore and muſe upon the Churches ſins and ſufferings? No, he had ſomething to ſay to his God, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Why is my pain perpetual?</hi> And God then hath ſomething to ſay to him by way of gracious anſwer, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>If thou return, then will I bring thee again, and thou ſhalt ſtand before me:</hi> This is the reſult of his ſecret Prayer, a reſtauration of him to, and his confirmation in, his office and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40964:17"/> and to the publick exerciſe thereof: This is worth praying for.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Daniel</hi> is a famous pattern of the reſolute and couragious performance of this duty, againſt all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: Although he might have pleaded, (if ever any) There's a Lion in the way, I ſhall be ſlain in the Streets or Den, for my work in my Chamber: yet he feared nothing, he ventured upon a ſevere Law, his Princes diſpleaſure, the loſs of his Preferment, the rage of his Competitors, and the Lions hungry ſtomachs, rather than he will omit or intermit his accuſtomed courſe of Chamber-worſhip; he will endure the Lions cruelty, rather than neglect a known duty: Nay, he is ſo far from gratifying his proud adverſaries, that he will not in the leaſt abate his wonted frequency, or viſibility in the duty; <hi>But his windows being open toward</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>be kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed, Dan</hi> 6.10. But did <hi>Daniel</hi> hold out a Flag, or blow a Trumpet, by ſetting open his windows to declare to men what he was a going to do? Was not this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the rule in the Text? Are we here commanded to ſhut our door, and may <hi>Daniel</hi> open his window? Is not that all one? Surely that good man did not open his windows out of hypocriſie and vain-glory; but to ſhew his reſolution, courage and conſtancy, out-daring theſe impious impudent commands of men: he did not fear to be ſeen now in ſo plain a caſe. What ſpirit are they of, that will rather give themſelves to the roaring Lion, and incur the wrath of the King of Heaven, which is more terrible than a thouſand hungry Lions, than ſolemnly perform this uſeful duty of ſecret Prayer: Let careleſs ſouls conſider this.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Peter</hi> a famous Apoſtle ſhall be another inſtance in the caſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.40. When <hi>Tabitha</hi> or <hi>Dorcas</hi> lay dead in an upper Chamber, and the Widows ſtood weeping by her, and he was to raiſe her, <hi>He put them all forth, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40964:18"/> kneeled down and prayed, and turning him to the body, ſaid,</hi> Tabitha <hi>ariſe, and ſhe opened her eyes</hi> — See here, another miracle like <hi>Elijah</hi>'s, upon ſecret Prayer: But this was upon an extraordinary caſe, did <hi>Peter</hi> uſe to pray alone? Yes, turn but to the next Chapter, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Peter went up upon the houſe-top to pray, about the ſixth hour:</hi> Which was about noon, another praying ſeaſon;<note place="margin">Pſal. 55.17.</note> certainly he miſſed not morning and night for ſuch devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He went to the top of the flat-rooft houſe, which was a private place, and equivalent to a Cloſet; there <hi>Peter</hi> prayed, and in that prayer he fell into a trance, and in that trance he had a Viſion concerning the calling in of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> a glorious myſtery and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent mercy towards us poor Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.25.

                  <p n="10">10. The laſt Inſtance is of our bleſſed Saviour, our dear Lord Jeſus was very converſant in this Duty: <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.35. <hi>In the morning, riſing up a great while before day, he went out and departed into a ſolitary place, and there prayed:</hi> Our precious Redeemer went about doing good, and the day time he uſually ſpent in preaching, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, healing diſeaſes, &amp;c. And the night he ſpent in prayer, meditation, and ſuch other holy exerciſes: he had ſcarce time to eat or ſleep for doing his fathers work; he ſpent not one moment of time unprofitably in a above thirty years: How early doth he riſe, and earneſtly doth he follow his buſineſs for communion

And this may be of ſingular uſe; for by ſuch heart-reaſonings and debates a Saint may wind up his ſpirit, and get better prepared for the remaining part of the exerciſe: Now ſuch a work as this would not be ſo ſeaſonable and convenient, when others joyn in the duty: So alſo for bodily poſtures; ſometimes for an evidence of greater humiliation, a Chriſtian finds it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to proſtrate himſelf before the Lord: And uſe ſuch geſtures as would not be fit in the ſight of others; therefore Cloſet-Prayer is very neceſſary, where a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may uſe his diſcretion as God ſhall direct him, for the humbling, quickning, raiſing and melting of his heart before the Lord alone: That's the firſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. The poor Soul can more freely open his heart to God in a Cloſet.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. A Soul in ſecret making its addreſſes to God, goes to him as a Father: Now, we know children cannot be ſo free in their addreſſes to their Father, in company and before ſtrangers, as when no body is preſent: Hence it is, that when a child hath any ſpecial buſineſs to his Father, he takes him aſide, or whiſpers to him, that none may over-hear him: And obſerve it, Gods children have an errand to God that none muſt know of: As <hi>Ehud</hi> ſaid to <hi>Eglon, I have a ſecret errand to thee, O King, Judg.</hi> 3.19. So a gracious ſoul may ſay, Oh my King, my God, my Father, <hi>I have a ſecret errand to thee.</hi> A luſt to confeſs, or mercy to beg or bleſs thee for, that I would not have others to know of: It is not fit any ſhould be privy to that which a gracious ſoul tells God of: In this caſe it may be ſaid, <hi>Diſcover not thy ſecret to another, Prov.</hi> 25.9. Two may keep coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, but three cannot: God and a gracious Soul will be faithful to each other, but a third muſt not know of theſe matters; nay in this caſe we may ſay, <hi>Keep the doors of thy lips from her that lyeth in thy boſom, Mic.</hi> 7.5. There are many things a Saint tells God of, that he will not acquaint either Father, or Wife, or Friend
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40964:21"/> with, that is as his own ſoul, but only his heavenly Father; he opens his boſom freely to him, and tells him his whole heart, beſt and worſt; hides nothing from him, becauſe he only knows the heart: And truly I have often in this admired the wiſdom of God, that hath ſo far conſulted his peoples credit and modeſty as to appoint them place and ways of ſpeaking to him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, deſigning ſecret Prayer for this very end, that the ſoul may ſpread its letter of wants and complaints before its Father, and preſent its petition to the King of Heaven: The Spouſe of Chriſt is modeſt (ſaith an Ancient) and cannot ſo freely let out her ſelf to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved before others as in a corner: here then comes in the uſe and advantage of Cloſet-Prayer, that a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may (as <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi> did, unboſom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to each other alone) open his heart to God where no eyes ſee, or ears hear his ſecret groans and tears: But further.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God will more familiarly communicate himſelf to the ſoul in a corner: he alſo hath ſomething to whiſper in the believers ear, that none muſt know of; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gets it by it ſelf: a lively emblem whereof we have in <hi>Joſephs making himſelf known to his Brethren,</hi> when his bowels were working, <hi>and he could not refrain himſelf, he cryed,</hi>

Oh when God finds a ſoul alone by it ſelf, having ſet it ſelf purpoſely to meet him, then he reveals his love, unvails his face, unlocks his bleſſed cheſt, diſtributes doles of love and grace, kiſſes it with the kiſſes of his mouth, and ſends it not away empty, but full of grace and peace. Thus that word of <hi>Solomon</hi> is verified, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.10. <hi>The heart knoweth his own bitterneſs, and a ſtranger intermeddles not with his joy, i. e.</hi> No creature on earth is privy to the ſecret groans or ſweeteſt ſolace of a retired Saint: That's the ſecond Reaſon.</p>

Will he never ſet himſelf ſolemnly to tranſact betwixt my ſelf and him in Prayer and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the moſt important buſineſs of his ſoul? Ah ſirs, the Omnipreſent God takes notice of all your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into and out of your chambers, and expects that ſometimes at leaſt your ſouls ſhould wait upon him: And why ſhould Chriſtians fruſtrate his expectation?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>God ſees in ſecret,</hi> Therefore he hath ſeen thy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins, and ſins in ſecret: Thy cloſs and Cloſet-wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs is naked and open before the piercing eyes of an all-ſeeing God; therefore ſhould thy Cloſet-tears and Prayers teſtifie thy ſound and ſaving repentance.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40964:25"/> drawn from Gods munificence: Wherein we have, 1. The promiſe, that's a reward, 2. The manner of performance openly: This is a comfortable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, 'tis worth ſomething to know that our labour is not loſt, it ſhall be rewarded, yea it ſhall be rewarded by God, whoſe rewards are great like himſelf, yea it ſhall be rewarded by thy Father. A Father takes in good part a little ſervice from an obedient child, and gives a great reward for a little work; yea Cloſet-Prayer ſhall be openly rewarded. The obſervableneſs of the mercy inhanceth the rates of it; tending more to the Chriſtians comfort, example to others, incouragement to right worſhippers, and glory to God: All theſe things might take up much time, but I ſhall only hint what is that open reward that God gives to ſuch as are conſtant in Cloſet-Prayer: That's theſe four wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By returning a viſible anſwer to ſecret Prayer: None ſaw <hi>Jacobs</hi> wreſtling hand to fiſt (as it were) with the Angel;<note place="margin">Gen. 32.24. with Chap. 33.4.</note> but all might obſerve the loving embraces betwixt that good man and his hoſtile brother <hi>Eſau:</hi> There was no witneſs of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s interceſſion for <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Mount; but all the congregation and the whole world,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.10, 11, 14.</note> may bear witneſs of Gods hearing his Prayer, for ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an offending people: When <hi>Eli</hi> obſerved <hi>Hanna</hi>'s lips move, and heard no voice, he misjudged her to be a drunken woman: but the truth is, ſhe was buſie with her God in earneſt Prayer; and though he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it then, yet afterwards he ſaw the effect, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13. with <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him: (Ecce ſignum)</hi> behold a ſign of his favour! behold an evident token that I prayed in truth!

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40964:25"/> Husband; and ſee here the fruit of my ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions in a corner: None ſaw my Tears, all may ſee my Child; none heard my cryes in Prayer, but the voice of my <hi>Samuel</hi> may be heard by all <hi>Iſrael:</hi> He ſhall carry the memorial of anſwer to ſecret Prayer in his name to the grave: And cannot many a ſoul ſpeak the ſame language? Cannot you ſeal to the ſame or like experiment? Cannot ſome of Gods children ſay, This mercy I got from God in ſuch a Room, Chamber, or Cloſet? No creature upon earth knew what I did there. But now all may ſee the happy effects of my hard tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, I find that 'tis not in vain to ſeek God in private; none knows the meaning of the mercy but my ſelf. I may call it <hi>Napthali,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 38.8.</note> for with great wreſtlings have I wreſtled with my God and prevailed. This mercy bears a double price to all the reſt, for 'tis won by Prayer, and now may be worn with praiſes and triumphing; ſo that a ſoul may ſay, This is my God, I have waited for him, he will ſave me,<note place="margin">Iſa. 25.9.</note> this is [my God] <hi>Jehovah,</hi> I have waited for him, I will be glad and rejoyce in his ſalvation: Lo here he is, I can now make my boaſt of my God. Wicked men are wont to ſay, Where is thy God? Now I can anſwer them, Lo this is he that returns ſuch anſwers to my Prayer, that, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſo gloriouſly for me, This is my God in whom I have truſted, on whom I have called, and he hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I am not diſappointed: Bleſſed be God, theſe appearances are the viſible returns of my ſecret prayers.</p>

I have had his company many times in a corner, and now I cannot but remember the kindneſs of his youth and old age, the love of his eſpouſals when he went after me in ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary places, rather than want my preſence: He hath viſited me in duty, and I have viſited him in mercy: Oh what mutual embraces, and reciprocal exchanges of love have there been betwixt us! He hath owned me, and I have owned him in the day of adverſity: When ever he had any doubt or want, or fear, or affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I heard from him in a Cloſet; he ſent his wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meſſenger of a believing Prayer to the throne of grace, and I took it well from him. I did not deſpiſe his perſon, or deny his ſuit; when others have been ſporting away time in vain recreations, or damning their ſouls in prophane practices, this ranſomed Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever when he could ſteal a little time, run into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and there did make his moan to me; and then I gave him ſomething worth his pains, I ſent him away with a chearful heart and thankful tongue: And now take notice all ye Angels and Men, I declare that I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this Soul's labour of love, and pardon all its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, &amp; ſet him in my immediate preſence in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal manſions: He that ſeparated himſelf from the world, ſhall now be ſeparated from the goats, and be ſet on
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40964:29"/> my right hand; he that longed ſo much to enjoy me, ſhall everlaſtingly enjoy me, without ceſſation, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption: Oh bleſſed day! Oh tranſcendent reward! Is not this a rewarding openly? You'l ſay, How do you know that Jeſus Chriſt will thus beſpeak a praying Soul? I reply, though we know not the form of words he will ſpeak, yet that a diſcovery ſhall be made of the acts of piety and charity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. evidently declares. Yea, that ſecret duties ſhall be brought to light as well as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins, the Scriptures declare, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.—<hi>Who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and will make manifeſt the counſels of the hearts, and then ſhall every man have praiſe of God:</hi> Then good men ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive open approbation and commendation for their holy exerciſes in ſecret places: Then will God wipe off all reproaching calumnies of black-mouthed lyars, wherewith they have beſpattered the reputation of praying Saints, and clear up their uprightneſs as the noon-day, by letting the world ſee, how the Saints ſpent their time in corners, both alone, and with their fellow-Chriſtians, not in plotting but praying; yea pleading for thoſe that perſecuted them. Oh bleſſed day! Oh happy Reſurrection of bodies and of names. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then praying ſouls will not then repent themſelves of all their pains in private, when they poured out their hearts in prayers and tears, ſince now they are rewarded with ſuch a bleſſed <hi>Euge,</hi> and are openly entertained into their Maſter's joy and Father's Kingdom.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. IF Cloſet-Prayer be a Chriſtian Duty, then it ſhews us, that in Goſpel-times God ſtands not preciſely upon places: this holy Incenſe may aſcend to Heaven with as much acceptance upon the golden Altar (the merits and mediation of Jeſus Chriſt) as well in a private Chamber as a publick Church. Some have ſcornfully called private devotions, by the derogating title of Chimney-Prayers; and think to confine all religion to publick places: yea a great Scholar ſaid once, God heard Prayer in a conſecrated place <hi>[Non quia precatur, ſed quia ibi]</hi> not becauſe men pray, but becauſe they pray there, as though the conceited holineſs of the place added ſome vertue to the Prayer,<note place="margin">Judaiſmus eſt, alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare religionem ad certa loca. <hi>Hoſpin</hi> de orig. Temp. lib. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> or rendred it more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God. This is worſe than plain <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> to tye Religion to places: The true Goſpelized Chriſtian hath otherwiſe learned Chriſt. 'Tis true, in the Old Teſtament diſpenſation, after the erecting of the Temple, Prayer was to be made at it, or towards it, as it typified Chriſt, by whom our prayers are accepted: But that holineſs being ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, 'tis now aboliſhed by the Goſpel: Now that takes place, in <hi>John</hi> 4.21. <hi>Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye ſhall neither in this Mountain, nor at</hi> Jeruſalem,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40964:30"/> 
                     <hi>worſhip the Father, i. e.</hi> God now doth not ſo much ſtand upon the place, as the manner of worſhip, <hi>that they worſhip in ſpirit and truth, ver.</hi> 23.24.

Much hath been ſaid in controverſie concerning the holineſs of places; but this ſeems to be an undeniable argument againſt that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that if ſome places be holy by the Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of them to holy uſes, then it followeth that other places not ſo conſecrated, howbeit applyed to the ſame holy uſe, are more prophane, and leſs apt to divine worſhip than places conſecrated: which would directly contradict the Scriptures laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. polit. lib. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>16.</hi>
                     </note> Indeed <hi>Hooker</hi> teacheth that the ſervice of God in places not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, as Churches are, hath not in it ſelf ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of grace, and comelineſs, as when the dignity of the place (which it wiſheth for) doth concur, and that the very Majeſty and holineſs of the place where God is worſhipped, bettereth even our holieſt and beſt actions: Thus he.<note place="margin">

Divis 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 491.</note> To whom we dare not ſubſcribe; but rather ſay with Dr. <hi>John Reinolds,</hi> that to us Chriſtians no Land is ſtrange, no ground unholy: Every coaſt is <hi>Jewry,</hi> every town <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and every houſe, <hi>Zion;</hi> and every faithful company, yea every faithful body, a Temple to ſerve God in.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall not undertake a diſpute upon this ſubject: The duty of the Text clears it, If God command and accept Cloſet-Prayer, then he doth not make ſo great a matter of the place for this duty as ſome imagine, ſince it cannot be imagined that Cloſet-Prayer can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ordinarily in a conſecrated place (as they call it;) and there being no ſuch place where a duty can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40964:31"/> to which God hath more expreſly promiſed a reward, than what is performed in a Corner or Cloſet; and therefore we have no warrant to expect acceptance meerly upon the account of one place more than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, there is a common practice of ſome perſons, which is, to perform their private devotions in publick places. For you ſhall ſee ſome at their entrance into a Church or Chappel, whatever publick worſhip is in hand, fall down upon their knees, or put their hats or hands before their faces, and ſo fall to Prayer. I will not call this the ſacrifice of fools, but I judge it very unſeaſonable: for we ſhould joyn with Gods people in the publick Ordinances, and prefer them before any thing that we can then undertake: The original of this practice was,<note place="margin">Eo propoſito Dominus <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

I am ſure, it favours rankly of a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> ſpirit, for this is the fault our Saviour here rectifies, which was their private praying in publick places; and in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto directs his Diſciples to the duty of the Text, which is to pray in their Cloſets.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> The Nature of Prayer.</head>
                  <p n="2">2. WE may hence be informed concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, uſefulneſs, excellency, and efficacy of the duty of Prayer: I ſpeak not now of Prayer in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but in reference to Cloſet-Prayer. And on that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40964:31"/> account there are two Conſectaries hence, concerning Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It follows, that Prayer is an immediate worſhip of God: For what hath been ſaid, ſhews that we have to do immediately with God, yea that a man alone ſingly hath to do with God: therein it's different from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Gods inſtituted worſhip, which doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily require company; as in preaching of the Word, there muſt be hearers; in the ſeals of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as in Baptiſm and the Lords-Supper, there muſt be a ſociety, ſuch a number as may be called a Church: Hence the latter is called a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16, 17.</note> 
                     <hi>We being many are one bread, and one body:</hi> But it is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely or eſſentially requiſite to Prayer, that there be a ſociety; one man or woman, by him or her ſelf alone, may perform this duty of Prayer as acceptably to God, as if in the company of a thouſand Saints: We deny not the publick or private Meetings of Gods people for Prayer; but withal affirm, that the nature of the duty is ſuch, that it may be performed ſolitary and alone: Hence Schoolmen diſtinguiſh of Prayer,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aq.</hi> 2: 2ae <hi>q.</hi> 83: <hi>Art.</hi> 12.</note> that it is either [<hi>Communis</hi> or <hi>Singularis</hi>] Common or Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: Both have their place and uſe: Though they lay great ſtreſs upon Chriſts promiſe, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to be where two or three are met in his Name; which as we deny not, ſo we aſſert the force of this Prayer of a ſingle perſon according to the Text: We give both their due, without compariſons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prayer cannot be ſtopt in its aſcent to God: All the perſecutors on earth, cannot hinder a ſoul's praying. This is demonſtrated two wayes: 1. A Child of God baniſht out of all human ſociety may pray ſtill. Suppoſe a man were rejected by men, and ejected out of all companies of men, and were ſhut up in the Cloſeſt Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40964:32"/> or ſhut out in the remoteſt Wilderneſs; ſuppoſe a man were in the Caves and Dens of the Earth; yet ſtill he might pray and be heard, according to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Prayer, that, If Gods People were carried captive into the Land of their Enemies, far or near, yet if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented and prayed unto God towards their Land, and that Houſe of God; then he begs that God would hear them: and God teſtifies that he did hear this Prayer of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.46, 48. with <hi>chap.</hi> 9.3. The paſſage to Heaven is as near and open from one part of the earth as another: therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith he will <hi>cry to God from the end of the Earth, Pſal.</hi> 61.2. A notable inſtance for this we have in <hi>Jonah:</hi> he was got into the bottom of the Sea (as far from Heaven locally as one could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) into a great Fiſhes belly, which he calls the very belly of Hell; and as he was then far from men, ſo he looks upon himſelf as caſt out of the ſight of God, and he pathetically expreſſeth his miſery and hopeleſs ſtate. What doth he in this doleful plight? Why he will look towards Gods holy Temple, Alas poor <hi>Jonah</hi> knew not now which way the Temple ſtood, he had but a ſhort proſpect in that dark and narrow Priſon; yes, faith can ſet <hi>Jonah</hi> upon one of the Mountains of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that thence he may ſee as far as Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> and reach as high as Heaven; he prayes, yea cryes; God hears, and delivers: as low as he was he knocks at Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven gates, and his Prayer doth pierce the Clouds, it makes bold, and ſteps in, <hi>My prayer,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>came in unto thee, into thine holy Temple, Jonah</hi> 2.2, 7. Oh the ſtrange and ſwift motion of a believing Prayer! Let the praying ſoul be where it will, the Prayer will come to God's ear, and get an anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Child of God that cannot ſpeak a word, may put up an acceptable Prayer: ſuppoſe the tongue which is the organ of ſpeech, were cut out, yet a Saint cannot thereby be obſtructed in his acceſs to God by Prayer.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40964:32"/> For, as <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſaith, <hi>[Oratio formaliter eſt actus volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis]</hi> Prayer is formally the act of the Will; deſire is the ſoul of Prayer which God may hear, though it be not expreſſed, for he knows the heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Lord thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble:</hi> A Saints deſire is a real Prayer; if the deſire be right, words are but the outward garb, habit, or cloaths (as I may ſo ſay) of Prayer, the carcaſs or ſhell of the duty, ardent deſires are the life, kernel,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.15. 1 Sam. 1.13. Neh. 2.4.</note> marrow of the performance: Hence we find that <hi>Moſes, Hannah,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> are ſaid to pray, when Scripture doth not expreſs a word they ſpeak, nor is it probable they did make an articulate ſound: I ſpeak not this to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge carnal men in their lazy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited ejaculations,<note place="margin">Deus exaudit non ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum preces indicativas ſed &amp; optativas, <hi>Luth.</hi>
                     </note> as though they could pray well enough, and never ſpeak; or while they are working, walking, talking: Let me hint a word by the way to theſe. Conſider, ſilly ſoul, God hath given thee a body, and thou muſt offer it to God as a reaſonable ſacrifice; thou art bound in conſcience to pray and praiſe God with thy tongue, which is thy glory; yea let me tell thee, if thou haſt thoſe members of body, and an opportunity to pray thus ſolemnly with thy tongue upon thy knees, and doſt never do it, I queſtion whether thou prayeſt at all or no, ſince thou liveſt in the apparent neglect of a known duty: What I ſpeak of the Saints real (though ſometimes without vocal) Prayers is to commend the duty, and comfort thoſe Saints that may be put to theſe exigencies, that though they cannot ſpeak, yet they may pray, and be heard and anſwered.</p>

                  <p>I Might from hence take occaſion to diſcover the ſtrength and efficacy of this duty of Prayer, from the conſideration of Cloſet-Prayer: though but a poor ſingle perſon get upon his knees in a Corner, and have no creature to help him, yet he can even undertake to grapple with the omnipotent and eternal God, yea by his ſtrength may have power with God, as we heard of <hi>Jacob;</hi> who by ſingle wreſtling with him (hand to fiſt as it were) wreſtled a bleſſing from him: One poor ſingle <hi>Elijah</hi> could ſtand againſt at leaſt four hundred Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 18.36.</note> and prevail, having recourſe to the living God by Prayer, yea the Apoſtle tells us, that this <hi>Elijah,</hi> though but a mortal man, yet he ſhut up and opened Heaven, that it rained, and rained not, according to his Prayer; hence he infers an univerſal Maxim, that the effectual ſervent Prayer of a righteous man avails much; and illuſtrates it by that notable inſtance, <hi>James</hi> 5.16, 17, 18. But ſome may object, <hi>Elijah</hi> was a great Prophet, an extraordinary perſon; he might prevail when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: he anſwers, He was no more than a man, <hi>a Man ſubject to like paſſions as we are,</hi> a ſinful creature; he prevailed not for any merits of his own, but through faith in the Mediator of the Covenant, and ſo may we. There's not the meaneſt Child of God but hath the ſame plea:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Gurnal on, Eph.</hi> 6.10. <hi>p.</hi> 42.</note> God hath ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to give, ſaith one; but he hath no ſtrength to deny.

                  <p>BUt the perſons to be principally reproved at preſent, are the profeſſors of Religion, that acknowledge this to be a duty, but grievouſly neglect it. I fear, God's Children are not ſo conſtant and conſcientious in the performance of this duty of Cloſet-Prayer as they ought to be. Are not good Souls guilty of frequent omiſſions, intermiſſions, at leaſt negligent performance of this duty?

                  <p>For the humbling of our hearts in this caſe, let me propound theſe ten awakning Interrogatories, that we may mourn for our neglect of this duty of Cloſet-Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Are you not very unlike Jeſus Chriſt? Is not he the perfect copy that we ſhould write after? And do we not find him often in private Prayer? We meet with him in this ſolitary duty ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the day,<note place="margin">Luk. 6.12. Mat. 26.36.</note> ſometimes in the night, ſometimes all night; in a Garden, in a Mountain, he took all opportunities to go to his Father; <hi>All the dayes of his fleſh he offered up Prayers and Supplications with ſtrong crying and tears, Heb.</hi> 5.7. As he was a man of ſorrows, ſo he was a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40964:37"/> man of Prayers, and the ſharper his ſorrows, the ſtronger his cryes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.44. <hi>Being in an Agony, he prayed more earneſtly:</hi> And was not this for our exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? And for our advantage? Should we not learn of him? Nay, doth not our very Chriſtianity conſiſt in our conformity to Chriſt? Alas, how unlike him are moſt of us? Shall we paſs for Chriſtians, that follow not his ſteps? Was it not bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſtudy, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to be conformed to this bleſſed Pattern? Can we imitate a better perſon? Was it neceſſary, Chriſt ſhould wreſtle for us, and is it not as neceſſary we ſhould wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle with God for our own ſouls? Or, doth Chriſts pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us excuſe our pleading for our ſelves? No no, as it was for our example and benefit in the days of his fleſh, ſo his preſent interceſſion in Heaven doth both imply and incourage our praying: for we are to ask in his name, and imploy our dear Advocate, that we may ſpeed: And ſhall not we (as it were) ſet him awork, and ſend up our Prayers to be mixt with his ſweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe? The Lord humble us for, and pardon to us our neglects and omiſſions!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Are you not herein very unlike the Saints of God? The ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> are wreſtlers with God. God hath no Children ſtill-born, they all cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father: <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtled with God in ſecret Prayer, and ever ſince, all the Saints in all ages have born that name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.6. <hi>This is the generation of them that ſeek him, that ſeek thy face, O</hi> Jacob, <hi>Selah, i. e.</hi> That ſeek the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> did.<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.6.</note> And indeed every one that is godly will thus pray. There might be brought a cloud of witneſſes in all ages of praying Saints, that converſed with God in ſecret: 'tis recorded of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> that his knees were as hard as Camels feet with praying: Some have ſought out for private places to pray in, others have riſen out of their beds to pray; others have ſet days apart to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40964:38"/> themſelves in ſecret by Faſting and Prayer, others would never adventure on buſineſs without ſeeking God: Such as are acquainted with Eccleſiaſtical. Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or Chriſtian Experiences, may find ſtore of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this ſort: And why ſhould we be unlike our Brethren? Have we not all one Spirit, as well as all one Father? And is not this a Spirit of Grace and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? And is it not that which on all occaſions draws the Soul to its Father? 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Paul,</hi> when newly converted, <hi>Behold he prayeth! Act.</hi> 9.11. Others do not ſee it, but I know it; there he is in a corner, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſeeking me, Go <hi>Ananias,</hi> enquire for him, he is now one of you, a real Convert, for, <hi>Behold he prayeth:</hi> A Soul praying in ſecret is worthy obſervation, there's an <hi>Ecce</hi> put upon it, <hi>Behold he prayeth!</hi> And why ſhould we that pretend to be Saints be unlike our brethren?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Are you not herein unlike your ſelves in former times? When God did at firſt work upon your hearts, did you not then run to God in a corner? Did you not ſet your ſelves intently to the duty of ſecret Prayer? How often did God find you by your ſelves, ſighing, ſorrowing, weeping, bleeding, breathing after God, pouring out your hearts like water before the face of the Lord? And your heavenly Father pitied you, ſpoke very kindly to you, wiped off your tears, cheared your hearts, heard your prayers, and made thoſe dayes of grief, times of love. Oh the ſweet embraces that then were betwixt your ſouls and God? Have you forgotten ſuch a Chamber? Such a Cloſet, ſuch a Barn, ſuch a Wood? Where you ſometimes walkt and meditated, ſometimes fell proſtrate and wept before the Lord, till you had no more power to weep? If you have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thoſe bleſſed days, your God hath not: <hi>He remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thee, the kindneſs of thy youth, the love of thine ſpouſals, when thou wenteſt after him in a ſolitary Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, Jer.</hi> 2.2. Canſt not thou remember the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40964:38"/> day when thou wouldſt rather have been with thy God in a private Room, than upon a Princes Throne? Yea, thou thoughteſt thou waſt to do nothing elſe but cry and pray in ſecret: thou waſt at it every day, yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times a in day: How comes it to paſs that there's ſuch a change? That thou doſt ſo rarely go to viſit thy old friend in a Corner? Is he changed? Is he not ſo good and kind, as he was wont to be? Haſt thou found any fault in God? Or art not thou blame-worthy? What's become of thy ancient Spirit of Prayer? Why doſt thou forget thy ſweeteſt wreſtling-place? Why doſt thou not inquire for theſe good old wayes of communion with thy God.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. LEt me further expoſtulate with Gods Children, that are rarely exerciſed in this duty of Secret-Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Do you not deprive your ſelves of many ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments? Have not your ſouls had ſweet experience of raviſhing incomes in ſecret duties? How many plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant morſels have you eaten alone? Have not theſe ſtolen waters been ſweet? And would they not be ſo again, if you would open the ſame ſluice? Oh what hints of love might your ſouls have, that no creature would know of! Secret influences are conveyed to ſouls in ſecret duties; theſe you block up by neglect: Ah, ſirs, Are the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of God ſmall to you? Is communion with God of no worth? Why are you ſo unwilling to take pains to go to your Father? Eſpecially when you know he hath a kindneſs for you? Have you ever loſt by ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Will not your gains infinitely countervail your
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40964:39"/> pains? Ask thoſe that uſe it moſt, they will tell you, it is the ſweeteſt time they ſpend: Yea, cannot your own experience atteſt it? Did you ever loſe your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour when you ſet your ſelves about the work in good earneſt? Hath not this cloſs and privy trading with God brought in much ſpiritual profit? Beloved friends, you little conſider the good you miſs of, for want of performing this excellent duty: But that's not all.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Do you not by neglect of ſecret prayer expoſe your ſelves to many ſad temptations? Watching and Prayer are ſingular helps againſt temptation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.41. I have heard, that Satan hath openly profeſſed, that he hath watched when ſome of Gods children have gone out without Cloſet-Prayer, and that day he hath gotten great advantage againſt them, ſometimes by tripping up their heels, and caſting them down from their excellency, into ſome groſs iniquity; ſometimes tormenting their hearts with blaſphemous, or ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perplexing injections: Sometimes God hath left them to fall into ſome afflictive ſnare, laid by this ſubtil Fowler, which hath coſt them many bitter pangs, all this and much more hath been the fruit of ſuch neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects: Chriſtians, Have you not found this too true by ſad experience? When you have gone abroad without calling on God, hath not God ſecretly withdrawn from you? Hath not Satan obtained his deſigns upon you? Have not your hearts been growing out of frame? Some luſt increaſing, grace decaying, and your ſouls at the brink of ſome aſtoniſhing fall? When you have gone out in the morning without a good breakfaſt with God, Have you not been apt to gather wind and vanity to the prejudice of your ſouls health? If you ingage not God by Prayer to go with you, What ſecurity have you for that day? If God leave you, the Devil may do what he liſt with you, and hamper you in a thouſand ſnares and ſins.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:40964:39"/>6. Doth not your neglect of ſecret Prayer argue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle love to God? Or delight to be in his Company? When perſons have a dear affection to each other, they love to be together: Love delights in union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Yea, when perſons love intirely, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from other company, that they may injoy each other with more indeared familiarity; the preſence of a third mixeth the ſtreams of Communication, and mars their intimate communion: And if you did paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love the Lord, would you not withdraw from others, that your ſouls might injoy ſome freſh and refreſhing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with your beſt Beloved? How can you ſay, you love him, when you have no mind of his company? If you did indeed love him,<note place="margin">Cant. 3.5.</note> you would hold him, and not let him go,<note place="margin">Amor meus, pondus meum.</note> until you had (with the Spouſe) brought him into the Chambers of intimate communion, and ſolitary receſſes: <hi>Love is the weight of the ſoul,</hi> and draws it to the object beloved: If your hearts were raviſht with him you would take more pleaſure in converſing with him, you would bleſs God for an opportunity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying him: But this ſtrangeneſs ſpeaks a great defect in this noble grace: And would you be eſteemed ſuch as love not God? What a ſad thing is it to be low and ſcant in love to God under ſuch ſtrong engagements to love? Poor ſoul! have not thoſe ſilken ſilver cords of love which have been caſt about thee, drawn thee near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and bound thee faſter to thy God than thus? Have not ſuch bellows and incentives, kindled and increaſed thy ſpark of love into a flame? Lament thy ſin, and ſhame thy ſelf before thy God, for this decay of love, and dangerous neglect.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Do not you by theſe omiſſions declare your ſelves ingrateful to the grace of God? It's Gods way to hire ſouls to approach to him, by holding out promiſes of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40964:40"/> reward, as we do offer Apples, Fruit, &amp;c. to children, to intice them to us: nor is it a Bait to couzen and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare us but real offers of kindneſs to us, whereof we may partake, and wherewith we may be happy: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Prince deſire a Beggars company, with expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of dear affections, and promiſes of many kindneſſes, Is it not groſs ingratitude, if ſhe fling away, and ſcorn the motion? Or ſuppoſe a potent Perſon ſend to a poor man a loving meſſage, telling him he hath conſidered his caſe, and hath appointed time and place, that they two together may confer about the neceſſary concernments of this poor man; he ſhall have free admiſſion and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty without diſturbance to preſent his petition, and ask what he will, and it ſhall be granted; none ſhall be preſent, but only they two ſhall converſe familiarly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for the good of the poor man: But inſtead of a thankful acceptance of this kindneſs, the poor man picks quarrels with the meſſenger or meſſage, grows ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and perverſe, runs away and ſaith, I need neither his counſel nor aſſiſtance; Let him beſtow his kindneſs where he will, I will not meddle with him: Were not this groſs ingratitude? And how would it be taken? The caſe is thine, Soul that neglecteſt ſecret duties: the God of Heaven gives thee notice to meet him in ſuch a room, to negotiate freely the main concernments of thy precious ſoul, and thou art coy and ſhy, and wilt not come near him, but either plainly denieſt, or heedleſly delayeſt: Oh monſtrous folly! Oh groſs ingratitude! Be aſhamed of it, be humbled for it, thy God takes it ill that thou art ſo loath to be happy, that thou even forſakeſt thine own mercies, and wilt go twice as far another way to gratifie a friend, rather than go alone into thy Cloſet to pleaſe thy God and profit thy poor ſoul: How long muſt God watch and wait, and ſtrive and ſue, to have thy company; and thou doſt ſtill neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and grow averſe thereto?

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what you do: as you deal with it, ſo it will deal with you; if you do not embrace its call, perhaps it will not be preſent at your call: And what can you do in duty, without it? If you ſtrive againſt it, it will ceaſe ſtriving with you: Be it known to you, you have not this Heavenly wind at your command; and you may toſs in the boat of duty long, but ſhall not approach the port without it: Nothing but the Spirit of God can carry thy ſoul to God: And what can excite and comfort thee when thy Aſſiſtant and Comforter is ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſadned? Grieve therefore, Chriſtian, for thy grieving of the Spirit, lay to heart thy careleſs quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this holy fire; and let thoſe waters of luſt or negligence coſt thee the waters of godly ſorrow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that this ſin may not be laid to thy charge: Say as that Divine Poet—</p>

                  <p n="9">9. If you can only pray in company, what will you do when your company is gone? A time may come when you may be left alone, as Chriſt ſaith he was. You had need ingage the Father to be with you, that you may ſay as the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>Truly our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip is with the Father:</hi> 'Tis true, communion of Saints is deſirable, but external communion is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attainable: you may be thruſt out by divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, now it will be ſad to be at a loſs when perſons are alone: 'Tis a ſtrange expreſſion of ſome, that they know not how to live, it ſuch and ſuch Chriſtian friends or godly Relations be taken away; why what's the matter? Are they in the place of God? Is your ſpiritual life maintained by the leaden pipes, or by the living ſprings that ſtream through them? Alas, ſirs, if you more underſtood and uſed this art of drawing influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from God immediately through Chriſt by ſecret Prayer, you would not be ſo diſcouraged with the loſs of friends; you would ſay, Indeed 'tis true, my loſs is great, ſuch a one had a notable gift in Prayer, and ſpoke my very heart to God, but though he be gone, is my God gone? Is Prayer gone? Though I cannot get ſuch moving expreſſions as ſuch had, yet I opened my heart to God as I could in ſecret formerly; and there's the ſame refuge now, the ſame road unto this City and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary I went in, and therefore all my comfort is not gone, bleſſed be my God: But a poor ſoul that hath
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40964:41"/> leaned upon the ſtaff of others inlargements will be ſhrewdly put to it when that ſtaff is gone: And, Is it not a great diſparagement to a noble and immortal Soul, that it cannot treat and entertain its God alone? What, cannot God and an Heaven born ſoul converſe together without <hi>Auxiliaries?</hi> Muſt another interpoſe as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, without whom you cannot injoy communion with God? Be aſhamed of it, and chide your ſelves, as not acting ſuitably to your rational ſpirits, much leſs to a ſupernatural Principle of grace.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Laſtly, let me further demand of you, what if our Lord ſhould call you away and find you under the guilt of the neglect of this known duty? What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, grief, and jealouſie would poſſeſs you if death ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt you in ſuch a ſtate? What an hurry was forlorn <hi>Saul</hi> in, when the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were upon him, and he had not offered ſacrifice unto God? And what a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate plunge will you be put to when the King of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors is upon you, and you have not perſonally and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately been ſeeking God? Though you may be right and ſafe for the main, yet your ſpirits will be much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, and you will ſuffer ſhrewd rebukes from your own conſciences for your omiſſions, and will be put to that laſt prayer of a dying Saint (eminent in the Church) <hi>The Lord forgive me my ſins of omiſſion;</hi> and poſſibly may want that ſpiritual ſolace in a dying hour that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls may have: Oh what a bleſſed thing will it be, if our dear Redeemer find a ſoul upon its knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord? Oh the hearty welcom it will give unto its God! This is the time he waited for, he was got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a corner, was ſighing for his ſins, pleading for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, breathing after grace, and panting for glory, and behold, what a quick return doth his God make? Even while he is ſpeaking and praying, the Lord doth ſend a guard of Angels to conduct the ſoul into eternal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, where God and the ſoul ſhall part no more.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40964:42"/> Bleſſed, for ever happy is that ſoul whom its Lord, when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing! Now conſider of it, Whether ſtate would you be found in? And do not you know, his Coming may be ſudden and unexpected? Would you be found under neglect, or in the faithful performance of a duty? Would you not be carried from your Cloſet-devotion to eternal communion with God? Oh then take our Lord's moſt wholſom counſel, Take ye heed, watch and pray; for ye know not when the time is, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.33.</p>
                  <p>I might here challenge Chriſtians alſo, not only for their neglect of, but careleſs performance of this duty of Cloſet-prayer: with what ſorry ſhifts do we put off God? How hard, dead, unbelieving, diſtracted are our hearts in ſecret? God takes much pleaſure in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs: it pleaſeth not God that a duty be done, except it be well done. Many ſatisfie their own conſciences that they have prayed, but conſider not how they prayed: there's a curſe on ſuch as do the work of God negligently;<note place="margin">Jer. 48.13. Mal. 1.14.</note> and, that have in their flock a male, and offer to the Lord a corrupt thing: And it's a fearful thing to get a curſe upon our knees, when we come for a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: Look to it, God takes notice how you pray, the Devil ſtands under your Cloſet-window, and heareth what you ſay to God in ſecret, all the while ſtudying how he may commence a ſuit againſt you for your duty: Like thoſe that come to Sermons to carp or catch at what the Preacher ſaith; or (as one ſaith) like a cunning opponent in the Schools, while his adverſary is buſie reading his poſition, he is ſtudying to confute it; and oh, what advantage do we often give Satan to trip us and take us tardy? What occaſion do we afford him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us to God and to our ſelves, while we have our fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy garments on us? Yea remiſsneſs in our duties brings decay in grace. Tradeſmen may go behind hand by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40964:42"/> careleſs in their dealings, as well as by being much out of their ſhops: Alas, what ſad decay is in our ſouls for want of cloſs and conſtant communion with God? We have very perverſe hearts, we have much ado with them; when we would do good, evil is preſent: it is our great ſin we are ſo much out of order, even upon our knees. Satan ſends his imps to haunt and torment ment us, he jogs our hand when we are to write a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Heaven in our prayers; ſo that we can ſcarce make ſenſe of what we preſent to God: Our thoughts are unfixed, ranging abroad like a Spaniel to a thouſand objects, ſo that ſometimes we have loſt our ſelves, and know not where we are: Oh let us lament our vain and trifling ſpirits in ſecret duties, and turn us unto God for help, as a Servant, when the child he tends is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom, and will not be ruled by him, calls out to the Father to come to him, who no ſooner ſpeaks the word, but all is whiſt with him; our God can ſet in order our unruly ſpirits, only he will be called upon by earneſt Prayer.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. Look to your State and ſtanding: If you be not real Saints, you are not fit for this ſpiritual duty: Your Relation muſt be changed by converting grace: Hence the Text ſaith, <hi>Pray to thy Father.</hi> See then that God be your Father in Jeſus Chriſt; elſe you cannot truly cry <hi>Abba, Father;</hi> If we muſt be reconciled to our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before we offer our gift, much more to God, for how can two walk together except they be agreed? I deny not but a carnal ſoul ſhould retire himſelf into a corner, examine his ſtate, fall down on his knees, and beg converting and pardoning grace; and thus they muſt acquaint themſelves with God, that they may come before him; for unſound unconverted ſinners have no right as children to call to the King of Heaven, though as creatures they may and muſt ſeek unto God, yet they worſhip afar off. 'Tis the gracious Chriſtian only that prayeth acceptably; wicked mens prayers are abomination; an hypocrite ſhall not come before him, <hi>John</hi> 13.16. And indeed, till you be real Saints, you'l have no mind to buckle cloſe to this duty: truth of grace will capacitate you for ſecret approaches to God; ſtrength of grace will elevate you to God; and evidence of ſincerity will make you come boldly to the Throne of Grace: Therefore try your ſtate, inquire what relation you have to God, or elſe expect no fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with him. God will not take the wicked by the hand to lead them into theſe Chambers of communion the throne of iniquity hath no fellowſhip with him. Our Lord Jeſus marrieth none but Widows that are divorced from all other Husbands, and he opens his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40964:43"/> heart to none but his betrothed Spouſe, her he leads in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſolitary place and ſpeaks to her heart: Oh ſirs! come over clearly to God, by cloſing with Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce your ſelves, get united to him, and then come and welcom to enjoy communion with him in Cloſet-Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Diſpatch other things off your hearts and hands: Let not your earthly occaſions intrude into your Cloſet-Exerciſes: Say to the cares and affairs of the world as <hi>Abraham</hi> to his Servants, <hi>Stay there while I go and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord yonder:</hi> Or as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in another caſe, <hi>I am doing a great work, and I cannot come down to you:</hi> So do thou ſay, I have appointed other times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for attending worldly buſineſſes, let me alone with my God, every thing is beautiful in its ſeaſon: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God is as much as I can attend at once, I muſt not be diverted by other objects, the buſineſs I am about is of the greateſt importance, I muſt conſult how I may attend upon the Lord without diſtraction, and worldly matters have diſtracted me in God's ſervice, and have coſt me many a tear; therefore get away from me. Why ſhould the work of the Lord ceaſe? Why ſhould I be hindred from my God? What can you afford me that can be worth one hours communion with my God? Thus do you actually renounce the world, for you cannot mind two things at once: And obſerve it, If you leave any matters of the world tarrying for your attendance, the thought of them will attend you, and make you cut your duties ſhort, and run away before your hearts be warmed: Therefore, if it may be, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch them, however rid your hearts of them: The Heathen left their ſhooes at the Temple-doors, to ſhew that all earthly occaſions and affections muſt be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind when we go to God.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. SEt your ſelves in Gods preſence: Although you be not within the view of any mortal creature, yet the eternal God ſees what you are a going about: So ſaith the Text, <hi>Your father ſees in ſecret,</hi> darkneſs or cloſsneſs hides not from him: and 'tis more that one God ſees you, than if all the men on earth gazed at you: His eyes are ten thouſand times brighter than the Sun, and he is of purer eyes than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold iniquity;<note place="margin">Heb. 1.13. Pſal. 26.6. Pſal. 66.18.</note> therefore waſh your hands in innocency before you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs his altar: For if you regard ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in your heart, God will not hear your prayer: Therefore ſet the Lord always before you, eſpecially now you are ſetting your ſelves before the Lord; if that Caveat was enough to beget reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in an Heathen,<note place="margin">Cave, ſpectat Cato.</note> 
                     <hi>Cato ſees thee:</hi> Oh what reverence would the ſenſe of Gods omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence beget in thy heart, if duly weighed? Chriſtians, weight your ſpirits with ſuch meditations as theſe, God's eye is never off me, I am daily walking in the Sun; but now, I am ſetting my ſelf to pray in ſecret; I come to appear before God in a ſpecial manner; I may deceive men and my ſelf, but God will not be mocked; I had need now engage my heart to approach
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40964:46"/> unto God, that's the thing he looks for. Oh for a ſpirit ſuitable to ſuch a Majeſty whom I come to worſhip! Lord, draw out my affections, unite my heart, excite my graces that my whole Soul may be carried after God: Thus commit thy works to the Lord, and thy thoughts ſhall be eſtabliſhed:<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.5. Prov. 16.3.</note> when thou art ſetting thy face towards a duty, where thou art ſure to meet Satan, and carry with thee a corrupt deceitful heart, let God know from thy mouth whither thou art going, what thy fears are. Never (ſaith one) doth the ſoul march in ſo good order, as when it puts it ſelf under the conduct of God; and never is it ſo awful, as when it ſets it ſelf under the eye of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>I am God Almighty, walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi> When you ſenſibly diſcern you are kneeling before God, will not this make you perfect, ſincere, and grow ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier? If you think God be not in your Cloſets, what do you go to pray there for? And if you know he ſees you there, why do you not think ſo, and ſet your ſelves as in his preſence? The child will ſtand demurely before his Father, the Scholar before his Maſter; and ſo will the gracious Soul before God in duty, if ſenſible of his preſence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Muſter up your thoughts and wayes: Our thoughts and affections are like the ſtrings of an Inſtrument out of tune, and therefore we muſt take ſome pains to wind and skrue them up. This is that which <hi>Zophar</hi> adviſeth to, <hi>Job</hi> 11.13. to prepare the heart, and then ſtretch forth the hands: And for this end, it would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs when you come into a private room to pray in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, firſt to read ſome portion of Scripture, which may be of uſe to compoſe your ſpirits; and like <hi>David's</hi> harp to <hi>Saul,</hi> drive away your wild imaginations: yea the word read, may afford you ſuitable matter of prayer to God. More particularly, let me add one experienced
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40964:47"/> Help, which is this: When you are addreſſing your ſelves to God in ſecret Prayer, endeavour to fix your thoughts upon ſome particular ſubject to inlarge upon; there's no queſtion, but you have ſometimes one ſpecial errand to God, ſometimes another, if you obſerve your condition well; be ſure to mind that, whether it be to confeſs ſome predominant ſin, to beg pardon of it, power againſt it. You may have in your eye ſome grace that you need more than ordinarily, and ſee your weakneſs and defect therein, &amp;c. Now do not ſatisfie your ſelves in running out into generals only, but ſet your ſelves to plead the cauſe of your ſouls in that very caſe, which you have found out by ſerious inquiry, would moſt ingage you at that time to go to God about; expatiate principally upon that ſubject: And this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be a <hi>taking to our ſelves words</hi> (which the Holy Ghoſt directeth us to,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hoſ. 14.2.</hi>

                  <p>Now an intent and earneſt purſuit of ſuch a ſpecial ſubject at the Throne of Grace is of uſe in theſe two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You will find it an help againſt diſtractions, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, withdrawings from God; when you purpoſely ſet your ſelves to mind one thing, you'l be more intent upon it, and lay out more pains about it, than when you allow your ſelves liberty in variety of matter. When the ſtream runs one way,<note place="margin">Vis unita fortior.</note> 'tis ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than diſperſed into ſeveral chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, ſo, when the Chriſtian unites his ſtrength to plead with God about a particular buſineſs, he is uſually more warm and affectionate, and ſo leſs ſubject to diſtraction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will help you to enlarge your ſelves in ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular caſes before the Lord, in pat and proper
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40964:47"/> expreſſions, even before others as you have a call and opportunity; and this is that which is called, the gift of Prayer, which is of ſingular uſe, when a perſon can particularly and pathetically lay open a condition, plead with God, improve promiſes, and rationally expoſtulate even with the Almighty about a ſpiritual or temporal concernment: This holy Art is got by a frequency in ſecret Prayer, and particular pleading for a mans own ſoul: This is the laſt preparatory; think before-hand what buſineſs you have to God in a peculiar manner, and drive that nail (as it were) to the head: you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think to ſpeak of all things to God at one time, but take that which is of preſent emergent uſe and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſet your ſelves to inlarge upon that; follow that home till you feel your hearts be warmed and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and ſo have ſome tokens for good that God will return a ſenſible anſwer: You'l ſay, Muſt we thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves before every duty of ſecret Prayer; we have not time for it? I ſhall anſwer this in the words of my dear and reverend Father <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier:</hi>

                  <p>A Third ingredient in Prayer is, that it be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God's will; it muſt have a warrant from the Word; a word of Precept, or Promiſe, or Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, muſt be the ground of our petitions: a command is our warrant, a promiſe our incouragement; an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is our tract, and the footſteps of the flock wherein we muſt walk: He that asks amiſs ſhall not ſpeed, but if we ask any thing according to his will he heareth us; and then we know we have the petitions that we deſired
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40964:50"/> of him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14, 15. Now, we ask according to his will, when both the matter of our petition is aright, and our end in asking is Gods glory, and our own or others ſpiritual good: otherwiſe, if we ask of God what we conceit to be a mercy, and have not asked counſel at God's mouth; or ask ſo as to conſume it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our luſts, we may well meet with a denial: My friends, you may not ſay what you pleaſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God. <hi>Conſider, God is in Heaven, you are on Earth, therefore be not raſh with your mouth, and let not your heart be haſty to utter any thing before God, let your words be few, and well weighed,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.2. The work you are about is a ſolemn buſineſs, do not ramble in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant deſires of unlawful things; think not that God will patronize your luſts: and when you have ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that which you conceive is according to his will, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it wholly to his Will, ſay, The Will of the Lord be done: ſubmit your ſelves to his diſpoſe, for time, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, means, and all circumſtances for giving of it: ask temporal mercies conditionally, and ſpiritual Comforts with ſubmiſſion to Gods will; learn that petition, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> to pray it, as well as ſay it.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40964:51"/> goes away much ſatisfied, and God muſt needs accept his perſon and hear his Prayer: Why ſo? Why he hath ſound abundant aſſiſtance, meltings, quicknings, and inlargements: Alas Sirs, where is Chriſt all this while? I am afraid your advocate is quite forgotten, your ſurety ſet aſide as a poor inſignificant Cypher: And tell me, ſoul, thou that boaſteſt thus of thy inlargements, dareſt thou appear before an holy God in thoſe rotten rags? Suppoſe thy rags be Velvet, they are but rags ſtill, and are too ſcant a garment for thy naked ſoul; thou comeſt to unlock the ear of God, and open his heart with a wrong key; we are accepted only in the Beloved, and not becauſe we are inlarged. 'Tis true, evangelical aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance may be a ſign of acceptance, but 'tis no cauſe thereof: No no, our perſons and prayers are owned on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the account of our ſurety and interceſſour: Our dear Lord Jeſus, who dyed for us, he lyes leager at the Court of Heaven as our Ambaſſador, to plead for us, and to ſee matters carried fairly, betwixt God and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed ſouls, and ſhall we not imploy our advocate, and find him work? Or ſhall we think to go our own er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand? Lord, forgive this groſs ingratitude: Oh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whatever your ſtraitneſs or inlargements be, make uſe of him, who is at Gods right hand, lay your ſacrifices on this golden Altar; lay the whole ſtreſs of your acceptance upon Chriſts meritorious interceſſion; act faith on him who mingles his ſweet incenſe with your ſorry performances: Oh look after our <hi>Aaron</hi> who is gone into the Holy of Holies for us: Conſider, friends, it would be ſad with you if you were to be judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt ſecret duties that ever you perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: It's good to have an inlarged heart in ſecret, yet there's danger in it, and it may undo us, becauſe our naughty hearts are apt to boaſt of, and truſt to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements; therefore 'tis better for us ſometimes to be ſtraitned than conſtantly inlarged in our Cloſet-Prayers:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40964:52"/> This is that which hath made ſome ſay that their duties have done them more hurt than their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; and the reaſon is plain, becauſe our corrupt hearts are ſo apt to depend upon the former, when as we are daunted and emptied of our ſelves by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the latter: The Lord help us all in this main buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40964:53"/> meet, ſo they may conveniently be together: If you have not a convenient room within doors, yet a good heart will not diſdain to go meet its Beloved in any coat, or barn, or wood: <hi>Iſaac walkt out into the Fields to pray and meditate:</hi> See you chuſe a private place wherever it be, according to the nature of the duty, before opened to you; obſerve God's providence in diſpoſing of you, and accept ſuch place as he ſhall offer to you.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. When you have been before the Lord in Cloſet-Prayer, obſerve how God hath been dealing with your hearts, that you may be ſuitably diſpoſed and affected: If the Lord hath with-drawn himſelf from you, left you under hardneſs, deadneſſe, diſtraction, uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe; you are to mourn for it, inquire the cauſe of it, reflect upon your ſelves, ſee what guilt there is upon conſcience, which ſeparates betwixt God and your ſouls: And then (if time permit) fall to't again, lament the ſin; be ingenuous in confeſſion, make ſtronger reſolutions, remove all obſtructions, that God and your ſouls may not be at any diſtance, reckon ſtreight, and make up your accounts, part friends, that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40964:55"/> you may meet friends the next time you go to him: If you find that God hath helped, melted, and graciouſly manifeſted himſelf to your ſouls, take ſpecial notice of it, record that for time to come, ſlight not the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of God, own him in, praiſe him for theſe ſweet manifeſtations of his love: Learn this leſſon even of <hi>Hagar</hi> the bond-woman: when ſhe was in a ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wilderneſſe, the Angel of the Lord comforts her, tells her God had heard her affliction, ſhe was with child, her ſeed ſhould be multiplied, ſhe in an anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble return to God for his kindneſſe, ſets an Aſteriſm of Obſervation upon the place, as a memorial of God's ſeeing, and looking after her, <hi>So the well was called Beer-la-hai-roi, i. e.</hi> the Well of him that liveth, and ſeeth me, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.13, 14. Thus do you: think and think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Oh, who, or what am I, that God ſhould look after me, or take notice of me in this deſolate ſtate and place!

                  <p n="2">2. Let your cariages at all times be ſutable to your cloſet prayers; let it appear that you are wholly devoted to God: croſs not your prayers with your practiſes, pray much &amp; live well: Let it appear you have been with God, that you have been drawing your influences from the ſpring-head; walk with men as thoſe that walk with God: Let the ſmell and ſavour of your heavenly converſings break forth in your gracious expreſſions, and exemplary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations: Live not after the ordinary rate of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors: As your heart is God-wards, ſo let your light be Men-wards, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie God: Carry ſomething out of your Cloſets,

Oh how ſad is't for a ſoul to come down from Cloſet-prayer, and be proud, paſſionate, envious, or covetous? And ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; then you are moſt in danger: for then doth <hi>Satan</hi> tempt moſt, and your hearts are then moſt apt to be ſecure, conceited, and carnally confident, as though you had done enough, and might now ſit down and take your eaſe: And having ſweat at duty, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly cooling, the gracious ſoul doth contract a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſurfeit, and fall into a languiſhing condition: Be jealous therefore of your ſelves when you have been with God in ſecret, and have an eye upon the devil, who is like a cheater who ſtrikes in with a young heir, when he hath newly received his rents, and never leaves him till he hath eaſed him of his money: Oh now walk wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and watchfully, conſider where you have been, and do nothing contrary to your communion or profeſſion: Let it never be ſaid of you as ſome are apt to ſay, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what ſuch perſons do ſo much alone! unleſs they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved better, and carried themſelves after another order: they pretend devotion, but there's little ſeen in their converſation, they will talk as vainly, live as wantonly, be as hard and falſe in their way of trading, and be as proud, ſcornful, perfidious and injurious as others are: Ah Chriſtians, let it never be ſaid thus; at leaſt give no

                  <p n="3">3. ANother duty after you have been with God in ſecret, is, To expect a ſeaſonable return: Stand upon your watch, hearken what God will ſpeak; <hi>

So do you: Chriſtians, look up to ſee what becomes of your Prayers, obſerve what anſwers God gives in. It is an unmannerly mocking another, (<hi>Pilate</hi>-like) to ask a queſtion and expect no anſwer: and is not this a groſs ſoloeciſm in Religion, to ſpeak many things to God, and expect no return? 'Tis certainly a great fault among Chriſtians, to pray and pray, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to conſider or gather up the fruits of Prayer: Is it not a ſtrange piece of folly, for men to be alwayes ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and never to look for an harveſt? Surely Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have more harveſts than they are aware of: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Sirs, obſerve how you reap, take ſpecial notice of any thing that looks like a Return of Prayer; examine it throughly, gather ſomething out of it, catch at what comes from the King of Heaven, as <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s ſervants did by the King of <hi>Iſraels</hi> words; and if there be but an hint, lay it up, make much of it, improve it, praiſe God for it, and hope for more: It is the negligence or unwarrantable modeſty of ſome Chriſtians, to think that they can expect no fruit of their Prayers, becauſe of the imperfection of their duties, forgetting Gods gracious Promiſe to upright-hearted ſeekers, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring his ſtrict Juſtice to ſuch as ſeek him not in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40964:56"/> the due order: But ſirs, you muſt ſo be humble, as alſo to believe, ſo deny your own righteouſneſs, as alſo to improve Chriſts interceſſion; you are to renounce all conceits of merit in your ſelves, and yet look up for mercy from God. God hath graciouſly annexed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of acceptance to the performance of the condition; and if God have aſſiſted you to pray right for the main, you may expect his audience:<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.9. 2 Tim. 4.8.</note> for, God is faithful and merciful, both in forgiving our iniquities, and giving us mercies: Gods anſwers are larger than our askings; when we truly pray for a piece of bread, God giveth a whole acre of Land: as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, and tells us, That when his wife was ſick, he prayed to God that ſhe might live:<note place="margin">Luth. Colloq. menſ. fol. <hi>245.</hi>
                     </note> ſo ſaith he, He not only granted that requeſt, but alſo therewith he hath given us a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Farm at <hi>Zolfdorf,</hi> and thereto hath bleſſed us with a fruitful year. Inſtances of this ſort are endleſs: There's never a ſincere Prayer loſt; God always gives in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, only we either do not obſerve or miſtake them, and loſe the comfort of them: An anſwer of Prayer doth not alwayes come in the way we expect it; we look for it at the fore-door, and it comes in at the back-door, and while we are ſtill expecting the friend we look for, he is in the houſe; the mercy we deſired is received, only it comes in a way we thought not of, and are therefore apt to overlook it: Therefore take heed of confining God to your way or limiting him to your time: That's the third.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Communicate your experiments: And thereby commend this duty to others: Thus <hi>David, Come,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and I will declare what he hath done for my ſoul; Pſal.</hi> 66.16. <hi>This poor man cryed, and the Lord heard him, Pſal.</hi> 34.6. — Do you as I have done, and you ſhall ſpeed as I have ſped. Do not miſtake this: I would
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40964:57"/> not have you tell every one when you go to Cloſet-Prayer, or when you have been at it (that's a Phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal blowing a Trumpet) but you muſt, at ſome times, to ſuch perſons as you can confide in, or that you have ſome grounded hopes of doing good to, tell them your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, for their direction and incouragement; in this caſe, acquaint them how God is wont to deal with your hearts, what good you have found from God in that duty, and you queſtion not but upon a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious uſe thereof they may find the like advantage: And this would be of ſingular uſe; for hereby they have not only a rule for it, but the exemplifying of it in a Precedent; and we know Examples are of a prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature: Eſpecially, ſee that you put your families upon this practice; Oh what a bleſſed thing were it, if every perſon in ſeveral rooms of the Houſe were at work with God in ſecret Prayer! How bravely would that houſe be perfumed? How well would the Trade of godlineſs thrive? Surely ſuch an Houſe were a more bleſſed beautiful edifice than any Princes Palace under Heaven: It's the diſpoſition of Goſpel-penitents to mourn every family apart, husbands &amp; wives apart, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.11, 12. And of gracious ſouls, <hi>to be like Doves of the valleys, every one mourning for his iniquity, Eze.</hi> 7.16. There muſt be joynt-Prayers and ſeparated Prayers together and apart: Let not Chriſtians be content to find Chriſt in a Corner for themſelves, but let them do what they can that others alſo may enjoy him: this was the frame of the Church or believing Soul, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.4. <hi>When ſhe had found him, I held him,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my Mothers houſe, i. e.</hi> into more publick aſſemblies: And truly, Chriſtians, that man hath not found Chriſt at all that would not have all others to find him; Oh, thinks the Chriſtian in his retirement, that others did but feel and injoy what my ſoul hath ſweet experience of, would to God, my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40964:57"/> Wife, Brother, Father, Child, Neighbour, would but try this courſe a while; Oh what advantage would they get by it? Though I eat theſe ſweet morſels alone, yet fain would I have others to partake with me: In things of this world, perſons are apt to grudge others any benefit by what they have ſtoln, from others a view, but in ſpiritual advantages there's no envy, and if there be, it proceeds not from Grace, but from corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the more grace the leſs envy; and when envy is gone, perſons will be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative. Take away envy,<note place="margin">Tolle invidiam, mea tua ſunt &amp; tua mea.</note> and mine is thine, and thine is mine; true Grace or <hi>Charity is kind, envieth not,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. Now this I am perſwading to, that they that have found Chriſt would be ſo charitable to ſouls as to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the knowledge of him, and the way to enjoy him, unto others: Thus doth <hi>Andrew</hi> come to <hi>Simon,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> to <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> and both of them were (as a man finding a jewel, and cannot contain) overjoyed, and cry out [<gap reason="foreign">

I anſwer, we may uſe it as other prayers in Scripture; but, I conceive, the principal end of it, is not to be rehearſed every time we pray, but an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, platform, or directory, according to the contents whereof we muſt direct our prayers.</p>

                  <p>Therefore for the further help of young profeſſors, I ſhall briefly touch at the ſeveral branches of that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable compendious rule of Prayer you have in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. to <hi>v.</hi> 14. And the rather becauſe it may ſeem to refer chiefly (though not only) to Cloſet-devotion: what I ſhall ſay to it may be a practical analyſing of it, in its ſeveral parts and branches.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the preface, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> You may thus make uſe of it: Infinite and Eternal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, the Maker of Heaven and Earth, who dwelleſt in the higheſt Heavens, and in the loweſt hearts, who ſeeſt all things here below, and art a God that heareſt prayers; I am a poor worm at thy foot-ſtool, looking up to the Throne of thy Grace; caſt a Fatherly eye up on me, and though I be by Nature a Child of wrath, yet through Jeſus Chriſt make me thy child by Grace and Adoption, teach me to cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> with holy reverence and filial confidence, raiſe my heart to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, beget in me Faith in thy promiſes, love to my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and due apprehenſions of thy Soveraign power, and gracious condeſcention; that praying by the help of thy Spirit, in the name of thy Son, I may obtain good at thy Fatherly hands. Secondly for the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Petition, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name:</hi> Thus, O my God, I have diſhonoured thee all my days by my ignorance, pride, hardneſs, and unthankfulneſs, and I am unapt and unable to glorifie thee, but do thou glorifie thy ſelf in my converſion and ſalvation: help me to know and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore thee, to make an high account of thy titles, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, ordinances; to believe thy word, admire thy works, in mercy or judgment: help me with ſpiritual thoughts becoming my holy profeſſion, with divine lips ſpeaking good of thy Name, and a ſuitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation to walk before the Lord: Holy God, deſtroy Atheiſm, Ignorance, Idolatry, and Profaneneſs; magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

                  <p n="2">2. Petition, [<hi>Thy Kingdom come:</hi>] Thus improve it: Lord, I muſt confeſs, that by nature I am dead in ſin, and a bond-ſlave to the Prince of darkneſs, who rules in my heart, and leads me captive by ignorance, errour, diſobedience; but do thou, by the power of thy grace, caſt out the ſtrong man, take poſſeſſion of my heart; ſway thy bleſſed Scepter in me, bring my whole man to obedience, deſtroy Satans kingdom, propagate the Goſpel among all Nations, purge thy houſe, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thy Church with officers, orders, and pure ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; make Kings nurſing Fathers to it, convert ſinners, confirm Saints, comfort the ſad; haſten thy ſecond coming to judgement, and the bleſſed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Petition, [<hi>Thy will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven</hi>] Thus, Holy Majeſtie, I acknowledge my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ignorance of thy will, impotencie to obey it, yea, enmity and antipathy againſt it; my beſt ſervices are imperfect, my ſpirit repining under thy hand, and my will wilfully reſiſting grace, and ruſhing into ſin; but Dear Lord, inform my mind, conquer my will, order my affections ſweetly to comply with thy mind; teach me to do thy will in obedience, make me content with thy will concerning me in every providence; beget in me thoſe heavenly diſpoſitions that are in the glorious Angels, and glorified Saints, that with humility, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, diligence and faithfulneſſe, zeal, ſincerity and conſtancy, I may be actively and paſſively at thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For that Petition, [<hi>Give us this day our daily bread;</hi>] Say in this manner; Heavenly Father, I muſt confeſs, that by my wretched apoſtacie in <hi>Adam,</hi> I have
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40964:59"/> loſt my right to every morſel of bread, and deſerve not to breath in thy air, or tread on thy earth; my ſin hath put a curſe and ſting into every comfort, I can obtain nothing by my induſtrie, yet am prone to deſire, get, and uſe thy mercies unlawfully; thy bleſſing is only the ſtaff of my bread, help me to wait on thy provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a moderate uſe of lawful means; give me a competencie of outward comforts, thy bleſſing in the uſe thereof, and contentment therewith; and, above all, a right thereto in Chriſt, and prevent needleſſe cares and ſenſual delights.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As to that petition, [<hi>Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debters:</hi>] Thus plead it; Lord, I am wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully guilty of original and actual ſin, and am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a debter to divine juſtice: I owe millions, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pay the leaſt farthing, therefore deſerve to be caſt into the dark dungeon of eternal torments; but, dear Lord, thou haſt found a ranſome who ſtands in man's ſtead to be ſurety for him, O accept me in thy beloved Son Jeſus Chriſt, waſh away my ſins in his blood, cloath my naked ſoul with his glorious robes, give me ſaving faith to embrace him upon his own terms, free my ſoul from guilt and puniſhment of ſin, pardon my daily failings, and ſeal an acquittance in my conſcience, which tells me I do freely forgive all offences againſt my ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The laſt petition [<hi>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver from evil</hi>] you may render thus: Lord, it were righteous with thee to leave me to be aſſaulted and conquered by Satan, my ſouls cruel enemie; my heart is growing wanton, proud, and careleſs, apt to thruſt my ſelf into temptations, but unable to reſiſt or overcome them: thou maiſt juſtly bring me into occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and leave me to my ſelf therein; but oh my God, keep my ſoul from being tempted, or aſſiſt me in the hour of temptation, or recover me out of my foils and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40964:60"/> falls; ſanctifie my ſlips make my ſtanding ſurer in thy ſtrength, tread Satan under my feet conquer the world for me, crucifie me unto the world, ſubdue my fleſh within, and in due time take my ſoul above all ſins and ſnares, into thine immediate preſence.</p>
                  <p>And then ſhut up all with ſuch like words as theſe on that concluſion. [<hi>For thine is the Kingdom, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and the Glory, for ever, Amen:</hi>] Oh my God, I am unworthy thou ſhouldſt grant my petitions for any thing in my ſelf; all my arguments in Prayer, and grounds of acceptance I fetch from thy ſelf: Thou haſt a Kingdom of Grace, and Throne of Grace, from whence thou heareſt prayers, and diſpenſeſt bleſſings; all the Power is in thine hands, to give and forgive, to kill or make alive, and the Glory ſhall be thine, if thou hear my Prayer: and bleſſed be my God, for all my mercies. I aſcribe to thee, and thee alone, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſoveraigntie, omnipotencie, and glorious excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which as I deſire all may be given to God, ſo I am humbly emboldened by Faith to reſt upon thy power and promiſe, that in due time thou wilt hear my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts; And as a token of that my deſire and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, my ſoul doth eccho forth, <hi>Amen,</hi> Even ſo be it.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have given you an hint from the Lords-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, of directions for the matter of our prayers. I ſhall but propound another Scripture-Inſtance concerning Arguments in Prayer.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40964:60"/> of many pleas in Prayer, which they have produced in vehement Expoſtulations, as we may find ſprinkled up and down in Scripture, as <hi>Moſes, Nehemiah, Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> in their approaches to God: and above all, <hi>David</hi> through the book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> is exceeding full this way. But I ſhall paſs by the reſt, and fix only upon one Scripture-inſtance, and the rather becauſe it was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret or ſolitary prayer (of which we are now ſpeaking:) and there are notable Pleas therein, which may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuit our condition; therefore I ſhall briefly touch the parts of it, and recommend it to our imitation: It is that of good <hi>Jacob</hi> (who was trained up in this holy Art of wreſtling with God) in <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9, 10, 11, 12. His plea's there may be reduced to theſe ten Heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He makes uſe of ſuitable Titles of God, he calls him Lord or <hi>Jehovah;</hi> which denotes Gods ſelf-exiſtence, and giving Being or exiſtence to the promiſes, in firſt making them, and then making them good. Thus do you; Sirs, raiſe in your hearts ſuitable apprehenſions of God, and let your expreſſions be anſwerable; tell God, he is an infinite, omniſcient, omnipotent Majeſty, able to do beyond what you can ask or think, and that you neither need nor deſire any more than what his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power can effect: tell him, if All-ſufficiency cannot ſupply you, you are content to go unſped; but you queſtion neither his hand nor heart; you are ſure he both can and will help his Children in their need; he will make good with his hand, what he hath ſpoken with his mouth, for he is <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He pleads Covenant-relation to God. O God of my Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and God of my Father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and ſo my God! this is an admirable plea: if God own a ſoul in a Covenant-relation, he will certainly do it good; though his grace be free, yet when God hath choſen a ſoul to be his, he hath (as it were) ingaged himſelf to own it; now he hath laid his truth to pledge. Thus
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40964:61"/> then a ſoul may plead, Lord thou haſt been my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers God, and wilt thou not be my God? And wilt thou be my God, and with-hold ſuch a mercy from me? My Anceſtors found grace in thy ſight, and obtained thoſe very good things I am craving; and am not I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the very ſame Covenant with them? Are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes the ſame? Is there not the ſame Mediator? Lord, I come to thee in a Covenant-relation for a Covenant-mercy, and wilt thou deny me?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He pleads a warrant for his undertaking, appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God that he was in his way, ſaying, <hi>The Lord which ſaidſt unto me, Return unto thy Country:</hi> Oh with what incouragement may the ſoul plead for aſſiſtance and protection, that is in Gods way and work, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own appointment? Thus then plead, Lord, haſt not thou ſet me about this work? Haſt thou not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me a charge to do what I do? Have I not a plain poſitive Scripture-warrant to bind my conſcience? I dare not do otherwiſe: I may ſay, If I be deceived, thou haſt deceived me, but I am ſure, plain Texts are no cheats, I cannot otherwiſe underſtand ſuch a Command: and oh my God, ſince thou haſt thus ingaged me in thy work, wilt thou ſuffer me to miſcarry therein?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He pleads a particular promiſe, <hi>I will deal well with thee:</hi> Surely a comprehenſive word, containing in it all that <hi>Jacob</hi> wanted. Thus muſt a Chriſtian ſearch the Scriptures, get hold of a promiſe, ſpread it before the Lord, whether for ſpiritual grace, inward comfort, or outward ſupply, as thus: Lord, I find a promiſe in ſuch a place, to a perſon in my very caſe, pat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to my very condition, as if it had been calculated purpoſely for me in this juncture; now Lord, make it good to my Soul, and Seed; thou haſt made it good to others in my ſtate, and why not to me? Am not I an heir of promiſe? And muſt not I have a ſhare therein?</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:40964:61"/>5. <hi>Jacob</hi> lays himſelf under the ſenſe of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, <hi>I am not worthy,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of the leaſt of all thy mercies.</hi> This is the property and excellency of a Saint, to nullifie himſelf, and Omnifie God, as I may ſo ſay: thus <hi>Abraham</hi> in his pleading calls himſelf duſt and aſhes, and the Centurion judged himſelf not worthy that Chriſt ſhould come under his roof. Thus then, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe thy ſelf. Lord, I am not worthy to enjoy any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mercy, not fit to lift up mine eyes to thee, leſs than the leaſt of thy mercies; behold I am vile, I am not only deſtitute of merits, but full of demerits. Hell is my deſert, I can challenge nothing as mine but ſin, and the fruits thereof, Lord, I condemn my ſelf, do not thou condemn me, and caſt me from thee.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He is affected with Gods faithfulneſs in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his promiſes; acknowledging the truth of God ſhewed to his ſervant. There is mercy in Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a promiſe to <hi>Abraham, Mic.</hi> 7.20. truth in making it good to <hi>Jacob.</hi> Well then, with <hi>Jacob,</hi> thus plead: Lord, 'tis true, there was nothing of deſert in me to engage thee, either to make or keep thy gracious promiſe, but ſure, the word is gone from thee, yea and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all my treachery and unfaithfulneſs thou haſt kept it to this day: Oh keep it ſtill it depends wholly on thee; let not my vanity alter the courſe of thy mercy, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and accept as thou haſt done from my <hi>Aegypt</hi> until now.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Jacob</hi> further recounts his former meanneſs, his low condition: <hi>With my ſtaff I paſſed over this Jordan,</hi> I came hither in a poor contemptible manner, a ſorry pilgrim: thus do you plead, Truth it is, Lord, thy grace is abſolutely free, there was neither wit nor wealth to move thee to do what thou haſt done; I can remember the time when I was as ſorry and ſilly a creature, as was in all the Countrey; there was no capacity in me to do thee any remarkable ſervice, thou didſt not ſet thy love
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40964:62"/> upon me for any natural or moral accompliſhments, even ſo Father becauſe it pleaſed thee: and wilt thou now forſake me? Thou mighteſt have done that at eaſier rates.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Here's <hi>Jacob's</hi> Stone of memorial for by-paſt and preſent mercies, <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am become two bands, i. e.</hi> two great companies of wives, children, ſervants, flocks, herds; I may ſay, Theſe where had they been? 'Tis ſtrange to ſee poor worm <hi>Jacob</hi> thus rich, oh the bounty of God! So do thou ſay, Lord take notice what thou haſt done for me, muſt all this be in vain? Wilt thou throw away theſe good things? Wilt thou not rather crown theſe gifts with continuance of thy kindneſs? Wilt thou return to do me hurt, after thou haſt done me all this good? Doſt thou not remember my convictions, conſolations; my fears, tears, doubtings, refreſhments? Oh the paſſages of love betwixt thee and me! Shall I be the grave of theſe mercies? Lord forget me not.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Here's his ſenſe of approaching danger, <hi>Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my Brother—for I fear him,</hi> &amp;c. A Brother offended is harder to be won than a ſtrong City. <hi>Jacob's</hi> danger was a ſpur to his Prayer. A purſued Hart runs faſt for ſhelter; ſo do thou, Soul, when afraid; flie to the Lord, and ſay, Oh my God, I have deadly enemies, within, without; my caſe is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn, deſperate; I have none to run to, but thy ſelf: Haſt not thou ſaid, that <hi>in thee the fatherleſs find mercy?</hi> Other refuge fails me, no man cares for my ſoul: Lord relieve, deliver this ſinful wretch, elſe I go down into the pit.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Once more, doth <hi>Jacob</hi> plead the promiſe, and inlarge the granted Charter: <hi>Thou ſaidſt, I will ſurely do thee good, and make thy ſeed as the ſand of the Sea:</hi> Thus do you; ſtill ſeek out, ſuck ſweetneſs from, and put in ſuit the promiſes by earneſt prayer: In this manner; Lord, haſt thou not promiſed an heart of fleſh, a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40964:62"/> heart? Why then is my heart hardened from thy fear? Doſt thou not ſay, thou wilt give thy holy Spirit to them that ask it? This Lord, I want, to be a ſpirit of truth and illumination, a ſpirit of prayer and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, a ſpirit of grace and ſanctification, and of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; Oh beſtow this mercy upon me: Doſt thou not promiſe to take away my inqiuities by pardoning Grace for thine own Name ſake? And to ſubdue my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and increaſe grace, and bring me to glory? Lord, remember thy word unto thy ſervant, in which thou haſt cauſed me to truſt:</p>

                  <p>But, beſides thoſe, I ſhall propound to you theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulatory Motives.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Would you not be ſuch as make conſcience of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commanded duty? You are no real Saints, unleſs you have reſpect to all Gods Commandments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. If you pick and chuſe in your obedience, you are hollow-hearted hypocrites: And can you deny this to be a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? And will you ſtand dodging with God? Muſt he raze this Sentence out of the Bible, to humour your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and ſloth? Is not Cloſet-Prayer a Chriſtian duty? Dare you argue againſt it? Out of what Topicks will you fetch your Arguments? And do you acknowledge it to be a duty, and will not practiſe it? Your own mouths will condemn you: What needs any more Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes? But if you be real Saints, I dare ſay, you do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it; and practiſe it ſometimes; and why are you not conſtant in your obedience? Is it not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a Saint to do righteouſneſs at all times? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.3. Oh conſider this, and do not either neglect a command or omit this known duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Would you not have the truth of grace cleared up in your ſouls? Surely, there's no Chriſtian but would arrive at Aſſurance; and this is one way to evidence ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, being much with God in ſecret duty: As he grieves truly that grieves without witneſs;<note place="margin">Ille do<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>t vere qui ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne teſte dolet.</note> ſo thoſe religious actings are moſt evidential of grace that are leaſt obvious to the view of men; and whereby a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian approves his heart, only to the heart-ſearching God: Here's the true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> that can,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.28.</note> with <hi>Jacob,</hi> converſe with God alone, and ſeeks his praiſe, not of men, but of God: Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, a Chriſtian ordinarily hath not that comfort in a duty expoſed to others view, which he hath in that he performs betwixt God and his own Soul: For, there's moſt danger of ſelfiſhneſs in the former, and more ſelf-denial
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40964:63"/> in the latter: The wind of applauſe may blow men far in a creditable performance, but humility and ſincerity is moſt evident in ſecret Appeals to God: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, Chriſtians, you run to Sermons, Miniſters, good Books, and take much pains to try your ſtate by marks and ſigns, make tryal of this more compendious courſe to clear your ſtate; be much with God in Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Would you not be found in the practice of the power of godlineſs? Oh then fall cloſs to Cloſet-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Alas, ſirs, hearing Sermons, reading Scriptures, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing religiouſly, praying in the family, may be done only for faſhion ſake, and the perſon that doth them, may have no more than the form of godlineſs: Miſtake me not, I do not condemn the practice of theſe, nor them that do them, as formaliſts for that: God forbid, they are Scripture duties, but the outward part of theſe may be done without the power of godlineſs, but to ſtruggle with a man's own heart, to wreſtle with God in a Corner, to meditate and give up a mans ſelf to theſe duties, as in the preſence of God; oh, this ſhews ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the power of grace, and life of holineſs. This is heart-work, and that's hard work, coſtly duties, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual exerciſes, which is more than to offer God thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Rams, or a firſt-born Son: <hi>David</hi> would not offer that to God that coſt him nothing; and ſhall we be content with the ordinary duties which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with an eaſie plodding formality?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Would you not have your hearts caſed under preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing burdens? Are you in love with your ſorrows? would you not be rid of them? Behold, I ſhew unto you an excellent way to get eaſe, which is a recourſe to God in ſecret Prayer! I have heard ſome precious Chriſtians ſay, that when any thing hath lyen upon their hearts, ready to overwhelm them, they have run to God in a corner, and there have left their load, and thence have
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40964:64"/> gone, with good <hi>Hannah,</hi> and have been no more ſad: And experience tells us, that when any preſſing afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lies upon us, if we can unboſom our ſelves to an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend, though not a word of counſel or comfort paſs from him; yet that opening of our hearts doth eaſe, as vomiting doth an oppreſſed ſtomack. And hence, ſaith <hi>Job, I will ſpeak that I may be refreſhed:</hi> And Scripture backs this in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Be careful in nothing, but in every thing make your requeſts known to God,</hi> and unload your cares and fears into the boſom of God: but how? Why by <hi>Prayer and Supplication in Thanksgiving:</hi> lay your load on God by Prayer, and he will bear it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Would you not obtain boldneſs in acceſs to God, and familiarity with him? Oh, go often to God in Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-Prayer. Princes take more ſtate upon them when converſing with their favourites before others, but when none are preſent, they open their hearts more familiarly to them I know <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaith God, he and I are well acquainted, he is my friend, he viſits me often, and <hi>ſhall I hide any thing from Abraham?</hi> I'll take him to a ſide, and tell him my whole heart; ſo will God to you, he will communicate much to you, and you may ſay any thing to him, you are not ſtrangers to him, but may come into his preſence boldly, and he will make you welcom, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. On the contrary, what a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing will it be to have ſtrange thoughts of God in duty, or at death? Strangeneſs betwixt God and a ſoul is a ſad uncomfortable thing: Wicked men are total ſtrangers to God: gracious ſouls little imployed in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret prayer, are little acquainted with God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip afar off; but ſincere ſouls converſing much with God in ſecret, attain to abundance of intimacy with the Lord: and is not that a mercy worth a World?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Would you not have the ſins of others to bring wrath and judgment on the place? Oh then, let your ſouls weep and pray in ſecret places, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40964:64"/> 
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.17. This is the laſt and ſafeſt way to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the guilt of open crying ſins in the Land, even a mourning for them in prayer before the Lord: thus did <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>David, Paul,</hi> and all Saints: Yea <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s ſolitary prayer interpoſed betwixt flaming wrath, and offending <hi>Iſrael:</hi> thus did he ſtand in the gap, and you may make an attonement for the Nation: a gift in ſecret may pacifie that wrath that's already broken out againſt us. Wicked men ſin in ſecret, let us mourn in ſecret; yea they ſin openly, let us lament privately. The truth is,<note place="margin">2 Kings 17.9.</note> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins may undo a Nation, except the cry of the Saints ſecret prayers be louder than the cry of wicked mens ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins: Oh fall to it. Ariſe, cry out in the night, in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord — <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.19.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Would you not have your own ſecret ſins ſet in the light of God's countenance? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.8. then repent and pray alone, humble your ſouls in ſecret for your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſins. Are you not conſcious to your ſelves of much ſecret guilt? And doth not God expect that you ſhould ſet your ſelves to mourn over them, and cry to God for pardoning grace in ſecret?<note place="margin">Eccl. 12.13.</note> Do you not know that God will bring every ſecret thing to light in the great day of accounts? Nay, God may puniſh you openly,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.12.</note> as he did <hi>David</hi> for his ſecret ſin. Well then, anticipate that ſad ſevere judgment, by judging your ſelves, and deprecating his righteous judgment: I may ſay to thee, Soul, as <hi>Solomon</hi> beſpeaks <hi>Shimei,</hi> Thou knoweſt all the wickedneſs which thy heart is privy to: and where are thy prayers, and tears, and groanings in ſecret? Oh, ſirs, if others ſins draw you not to ſecret Prayer, let your own, which may afford matter of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant grief in your Cloſets and retirement.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Would you not prevent and circumvent wicked
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40964:65"/> mens ſecret plots? Be ſure then, you undermine them by ſecret Prayer: The Devil and the Pope have many cloſs and conclave conſultations to undermine the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and to root out the name of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from under Heaven: they are working under ground to do us miſchief; we have ſeen by the light of <hi>London</hi>'s flames their helliſh devices in their dark vaults; <hi>Wicked men lye in wait ſecretly as a Lion in his den, to catch the poor and murder the innocent, Pſal.</hi> 10.<note place="margin">Pſal. 64.1, 2, 4, 5.</note>8, 9. And now what courſe is to be taken for preventing theſe horrid deſigns? Alas, we have no other remedy, but the ancient Chriſtians wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, Prayers and Tears; theſe may break their nets, and blunt their weapons; good <hi>Jeremiah</hi> knew not that they had deviſed devices againſt him, but he reveals his cauſe to God in prayer, and then God ſhews him their doings, and prevents their attempts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.18, 19, 20. Saints Cloſet-prayers may break wicked mens Cloſet-plots: Fall cloſs then to this great duty.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Would you not be condemned by the Heathens Chamber-Idolatry? Oh then, do you perform Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Cloſet-Duties? They had their [<hi>Divos penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> or <hi>Penates</hi>] their Houſhold-gods, and Cloſet-images, they had their [<hi>opertanea,</hi> and <hi>tenebroſa ſacra</hi>] their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, vailed, and myſterious exerciſes in ſecret places: And the <hi>Jews</hi> borrowed ſeveral myſtical rites of the <hi>Heathens:</hi> hence we read in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.12. of <hi>Chambers of imagery,</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> at this day have their Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes, their petty-Chamber, Cloſet deities, where they drop their Beads, and do homage to their Idols; and ſhall theſe in their blind ſuperſtition condemn our irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? Shall it be ſaid of a devout Philoſopher, that in ſo many years he ſpoke more with the gods than with men? And ſhall it be ſaid of any of us, that God (even the true God) is not in all our thoughts? or ſo little in our lips; at leaſt, in ſecret ſolemn addreſſes to him? Let

                  <p n="10">10. Would you not be ſuitable to Gods diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? When the Lord our God puts us to ſilence, and into ſolitary places, he expects that we ſhould viſit him there: <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Oh my Dove that art in the clefts of the rock, in the ſecret place of the ſtairs, i. e.</hi> in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted perſecuted and deſolate condition, <hi>Let me ſee thy countenance, let me hear thy voice, i. e.</hi> in the duties of Prayer, praiſe, and Goſpel-Ordinances: <hi>For then was her voice ſweet, and countenance comely;</hi> when they are caſt out, then doth God expect and entertain them: And this advantage have Gods children had by privacy, into which they were caſt, as we heard before of <hi>Jeremiah, Chap.</hi> 15.15.

Every thing is beautiful in its place and ſeaſon. Gods Commandments are exceeding broad, and take in a great compaſs of duties. You muſt worſhip God in your Houſes; that exempts you not from worſhipping God in your Cloſets, no more than in the publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: There's equal commands for all, neceſſity of all; neglect any at your peril: Beſides, I told you, a Child of God hath a ſecret errand to his Father, that it is not fit his family ſhould know of; and upon this account God hath appointed Cloſet-Prayer, as tendering the credit of his people, that they might not diſcover their ſpiritual nakedneſs to any but to that God who knows their ſecrets, and will keep their counſel: And I muſt tell thee, Soul, thou art very little ſenſible of thy ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtate or wants, if thou have nothing to ſay to God that thou wouldſt not have others to hear.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I am glad to hear thee thus complain: thou art fitter for praying, when thou canſt lie under the ſenſe of thy inabilitie to pray, that's an uſeful diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in dutie: But thou ſaiſt thou canſt not pray, then I'll tell thee what to do; Go thy waies alone, and fall down upon thy knees, and plainly tell the Lord thou canſt not pray, and intreat him to help thee by his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit, which he hath promiſed to them that ask it: tell the Lord, that thou canſt not think a good thought, or ſpeak a good word without that bleſſed Spirit, but it ſhall help thine infirmities, and teach thee what to ſay: oh beg hard for that holy Spirit; and then, let ſome means be uſed to get matter of Prayer: you know it conſiſts of confeſſion of ſin, petition for good things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation of evil, and thankſgiving for mercies: Well then, ſit down, and think with thy ſelf, what ſins thou art guilty of; original, or actual; of omiſſion, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; this is too too fruitful a ſubject: take them home, tell God of them, by ingenious confeſſion: Then bethink thy ſelf what thou wanteſt at the hands of God, as Pardon, Grace, Peace, Heaven, and begg theſe;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40964:70"/> conſider alſo what thou art afraid of, as guilt, ſtrength, effects of ſin, Gods wrath, Satans malice; and deſire the Lord to prevent, and remove theſe, for Chriſt's ſake: And laſtly, recollect what mercies thou haſt had from God, and reckon them up to God, with expreſſions of thankfulneſs: Do this with plainneſs, and ſeriouſneſs; heed not ſo much for exact method, or fine phraſes: the gilt of the key makes it not open the door a jot the better; and a Prayer doth not work upon God any, rather becauſe of the neat language therein, but unboſome thy ſelf plainly, and ſeriouſly before thy God, and thou ſhalt find preſent aſſiſtance and acceptance, and future inlargement and incouragement: Be honeſt, though never ſo homely in Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Obj.</hi> But I like not this ſtir, it's an hard and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult work: I would rather do any thing than this, my ſpirit is wonderful averſe to it; ſay what you will, it will not down with me, to make all this ado in Cloſet-Prayer; it's pretty fair if I can keep up ſuch duties as Church and Family require.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the pleading of fleſh and blood, this is the bottom of the former objections, I expected this all along: if the tongue ſpeak not thus, the heart doth: let a duty be preſſed never ſo home, a carnal heart will make ſome evaſions; though the mouth be ſtopped, yet a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing heart will have ſomething to ſay againſt a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual duty: And if it cannot be mad with reaſon, it grows mad without reaſon, and againſt Scripture: 'Tis eaſier to bring arguments to convince the judgement, than to draw the will and affections to a through obedience: But ſoul, wilt thou plead for <hi>Baal?</hi> Wilt thou take the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils part, and yield to carnal reaſon? or wilt thou baulk any divine commands to gratifie a lazie humour, or a baſe luſt? God forbid; methinks, if thou canſt not obey as thou ought'ſt, yet thou ſhould'ſt take God's part, and plead for obedience: <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15, 16. Though
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40964:70"/> he ſaith, <hi>What I would, that do I not, But what I hate, that do I,</hi> — (yet ſaith he) <hi>I conſent to the Law that it is good: i. e.</hi> I take patt with God, and joyn with Gods will againſt my corrupt and carnal affections, that would draw my neck from under this heavenly yoke: And if you have not ſomething within you that takes part with Gods revealed will, you are not of God: But a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of grace doth facilitate and make eaſie the hardeſt duties, becauſe there is a likeneſs betwixt holy hearts and holy performances: Love makes every thing eaſie; hence it comes to paſs that Chriſts yoke is eaſie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.30. His ways pleaſant, and his commandments not grievous, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. If thy heart were right, duties would be ſweet to thy ſoul; 'tis no burden to eat, drink, ſleep; the acts of nature are delightful to perſons in a right temper; if they be not, nature is oppreſt, and out of order: A child of God in duty, ſo far as regenerated, is like a man in his calling, or a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in its proper Element: Beſides, wert thou more accuſtomed to duty in ſecret, it would be more familiar to thee, and leſs irkſom: We ſee by experience, Uſe makes heavy things light, we hardly feel the weight of our cloaths, becauſe fitted to us, and conſtantly carried by us, when as the ſame weight upon our ſhoulders would trouble us: Chriſtians, conſider all Chriſtian duties are not of equal difficulty; yet withal obſerve it, Duties that are hardeſt to go through, many times bring in the ſweeteſt income: And ſo is this; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it will abundantly recompence for your pains in it: Be ſure when a duty is lined with difficulty, and your corrupt hearts draw back, and have moſt averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it, there is ſomething of God in that duty, and God aims you more than ordinary advantage by it: Therefore do not ſay a word againſt it, but ſtir up your ſelves, ſpur on your hearts, ſhake off ſloth, and run to God, whatever Satan, the World, or Fleſh ſay to the contrary: thus much for the Objections.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>SECT. V.</hi> Some Caſes of Conſcience, briefly anſwered.</head>
                  <p>THere are yet four Caſes of conſcience I ſhall briefly propound and Anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Caſe.</hi> Whether may not an hypocrite or graceleſs ſoul perform this duty of Cloſet-prayer; and what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is there betwixt a real Saint and an unregenerate perſon in this work?</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is poſſible a carnal man may pray in ſecret, but with theſe differences: 1. He is urged to it by the challenges of an accuſing conſcience, he is (as it were) dogg'd to't, he dare not but do it; but a Child of God hath a gracious principle, inclining him to it, from love to God, and a deſire to pleaſe and enjoy him: Yet through the remainders of corruption, there's much unwillingneſs in the beſt; ſo that ſometimes a Saint muſt even force himſelf to the performance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An hypocrite will not thus pray always, <hi>Job</hi> 27.9, 10. 'Tis but in ſome pang, or under ſome preſſing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; and when this good mood is over, he takes his leave of God, till whipt to him again by the like: But a child of God is in ſome meaſure conſtant and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the duty, though he may have ſinful omiſſions and intermiſſions, yet never a total ceſſation from duty. Grace works the heart God-ward, and the ſoul is not content without Him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. An hypocrite doth not make conſcience to get his heart up to God in the duty, he is content with the work done, words ſaid; but a real Saint hath moſt ado with his heart, that's the hardeſt piece of the work; he dare not leave that behind him, and he hath much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do to get it up.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A carnal man keeps his round in formal duty, but
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40964:71"/> gets nothing; he prays to little profit or purpoſe, and indeed doth not much ſtudy to gain a ſpiritual good: But a child of God is a great gainer, he gets at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times communion with God, communications from God: Oh what good doth his ſoul meet with! Though not always, yet at ſometimes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Caſe.</hi> Whether may a Chriſtian bind himſelf to the performance of this duty of Cloſet-Prayer at ſtated times? Or, ſuppoſe a Chriſtian miſs his times deſigned for that work, what muſt he then do?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> To the former; that in general thou mayſt and muſt ſwear and vow that thou wilt keep Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.106. ſo doth <hi>David.</hi> And in Scripture we are bid to make vows, and pay them to the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.11. Vowing our ſelves and all that we have to God, is neceſſary: Sequeſtring ſome part of our time to his ſervice, is requiſite: And in ſome caſes for ſome perſons, it may be expedient to bind and task our ſelves by an holy reſolution, to take ſo much time, at leaſt every day for Gods worſhip, yea at ſuch a time as may be judged moſt commodious by our experiences. And this may be a good help to keep in our treacherous hearts from delay or dallying: But to ingage our ſelves to a particular hour ſo punctually and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as not to take another, may not be ſo ſafe; partly, becauſe our times are in Gods hands, and we know not what intervening Providence may fall in to prevent our performance, whereby conſcience may be intangled in a perplexing labyrinth; beſides, our outward occaſions, and the frame of our Spirits, may diſcover a greater fitneſs at another ſeaſon: Yet, though I would not have Chriſtians bring a ſnare upon their ſouls by Vowing, yet I humbly conceive that they may conſult conveniences and deſign ſome time for that work and purpoſe, God willing, to keep an hour of Prayer: And if they be hindered by a journey, or any unexpected unavoidable
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40964:72"/> occaſions, they muſt mourn for it as their burden, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double their diligence another time, not plead needleſs diverſions, lift up ejaculations to God, keep a praying frame of ſpirit, and God will graciouſly pardon and entertain them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Caſe.</hi> How may a Chriſtian know that he enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth communion with God in Cloſet-prayer?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Communion with God is twofold. 1. As to Graces, 2. As to Comforts. Sometimes a Chriſtian may feel the joy of Gods ſalvation, have the ſweet kiſſes of his mouth, ſmiles of his face, ſeals of the Spirit, and the lively ſpringings of joy and raviſhing pleaſures; theſe carry their own evidence along with them: But all have not theſe, nor any at all times; therefore the ſureſt way is to inquire after communion with God, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the exerciſe of grace in duty: then hath a child of God true fellowſhip with God, when by the ſweet aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit his mind is knit to the object of worſhip, the underſtanding is fruitful in ſpiritual and ſuitable thoughts, when the will and affections are carried out in ſtrong and panting deſires and longings after God: When the heart is throughly broken in the ſenſe of ſin, melted into godly ſorrow, affected with the ſweetneſs of pardoning grace, and ardently pleads with God for acceptance; again, when the graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are acted in the duty, as, an holy awe and fear of God, faith, love, humility, zeal and fervency, and a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to forgive others, as well as to be forgiven by the Lord: Laſtly, a ſoul may know when it hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, by the conſequences of duty, as when the Chriſtian is more vile in his own eyes, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was, gives God all the glory, ſees and bewails his defects in greateſt inlargements, when the ſpirit is left in a better frame, and fitter to bear croſſes, and perform after-duties, &amp;c. I do but hint theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Caſe.</hi> Suppoſe I have prayed and prayed, and find
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40964:72"/> not my heart affected; 'tis dead, dull, diſtracted, I do no good; get no good in duty, I fear I offend God, What ſhall I do?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Such a caſe is ſad: yet conſider, 1. It may be the caſe of gracious hearts, <hi>David</hi> was ſo depreſſed and troubled, that he could not ſpeak, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.3, 4. Gods beſt Children are ſometimes out of frame, their ſpirits unfit for duty:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A total neglect will not mend the matter, nor help the frame of your hearts; one ſin will never cure another; running from the fire is not the way to be warm: your hearts will not be better, but worſe, by forbearance; omiſſion indiſpoſeth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Who knows but God may come in the next time? Keep upon the Royal Exchange ſtill, ply the oars, give God no reſt, gratifie not Satan by neglect. Tradeſmen keep their Markets, though for ſmall gains: you'l get ſomething at laſt worth your pains; they never were aſhamed that have waited on him: The iſſue will be good.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God may graciouſly accept thy obedience, though thou have not ſweet inlargement, the obedience is thine, the inlargement God's, he is a free Agent, and works when he pleaſeth, he loves to ſee poor ſouls tug and ſtruggle with their own hearts, though they can get lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle forward, yet they would be better and do better: The Father takes it well when the Child is ſtriving to obey him, though it fall very far ſhort: He ſees, the Spirit is willing, though the fleſh be weak, and accepts of upright endeavours: Nay, obſerve it, a Chriſtians conſcientious attendance upon God without inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may be more acceptable to God than when he hath the ſweeteſt inlargements; becauſe there is moſt obedience in thoſe duties, but in the other a Chriſtian is (as it were) hired to performances by the Earneſt-peny of inlargements: Oh, 'tis a brave thing to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40964:73"/> in duty under diſcouragements; he that can trade when times are ſo dead, that all his wares lye upon his hand, yet trades more; ſurely his ſtock is great. So 'tis an evidence of much Faith, Love, Sincerity, when the Soul can maintain this Heavenly Trade, when his ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble incomes are ſmall: Yet when God thus withdraws from you, you muſt deeply lay it to heart, inquire the cauſe, make your peace with him, and ply the Throne of Grace with greater importunity: Thus much briefly, for theſe Caſes of Conſciences.</p>
                  <p>And now, beloved friends, I have diſpatcht this Subject concerning Cloſet-prayer, What remains, but that we ſhould all fall cloſs to the conſtant practice of this duty? What do Miniſters preach Sermons, or print Books for? Is it to be ſeen and heard in publick? Is it to be applauded? Or, is it not rather to do good to peoples ſouls? And can people get any good by hearing a ſound of words, or a complemental reading what is written? Is there not ſomething elſe required of you now, even a ſetting about the conſcientious practice of what is before you? What ſay you ſirs, to this Point? Is Cloſet-Prayer a Chriſtian duty, or is it not? If it be not, why doth Chriſt direct us to the right manner of performance, and aſſure us that our Father will reward it openly? Will God reward any thing but command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed duty? There's no queſtion but 'tis a duty, I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any man to diſprove it now, and to ſtand to his aſſertion another day before the God of Heaven: But I think none will deny it to be a duty; and ſirs, dare any man that profeſſeth Religion, live in the groſs neglect of plain duty? Do you think it's fit it ſhould be done, and will you not do it? Shall your own tongues be brought in as witneſſes againſt your ſelves? Will you be like that Son that ſaid, I go ſir, but went not? Shall God wait your leiſure, and you'l not give him a viſit? Will you go into your Cloſets to make up your accounts?
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40964:73"/> And will you not reckon ſtreight betwixt God and your Souls? Dare you go from day to day under the guilt of a known ſin? If you do not what you have read, this Book will flie in the face of conſcience another day. But I am moſt afraid, leſt Chriſtians trifle about this work, and ſhuffle it off after any faſhion, and ſo put off God with a meer outſide performance, to pacifie conſcience, without that warmth and life we ſhould have in our Cloſets: 'Tis recorded of <hi>Luther,</hi> that he prayed every day three hours, and even then when his ſpirits were moſt lively, <hi>[Per tres horas, eaſq, ad ſtudia aptiſſimas]</hi> Nor were his Cloſet-Prayers dull, careleſs, heartleſs; be ſo fervent and ardent, ſaith <hi>Melancthon,</hi> that they which ſtood under his window where he ſtood praying, might ſee his tears falling and dropping down: Oh but where is this zeal and ardency in our ſecret devotion? Are we not ready to drop aſleep, even upon our knees? Alas, how formal are we? The fire of God is wanting in our ſacrifices: Nay, do we not take Gods Name in vain many times, and know not what we ſay? Oh, why do we thus forget Gods omnipreſence and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? Doth not he know our hearts? And ſhould not we approve our ſelves to God in our Cloſets? Yea, doth not Satan ſtand under our Cloſet-window (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at our Elbow) and hears what we ſay to God in our Cloſets? If you take not notice of your miſtakes in Cloſet-Prayer, Satan doth; and takes advantage by them: Indeed, I have heard ſome make this a ſcruple, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they ſhould in ſecret confeſs heart-ſins, leſt Satan ſhould be acquainted with what he knew not before, and ſo be furniſhd with matter to accuſe them of, but an ingenious confeſſion prevents Satans accuſation, becauſe we have a promiſe of remiſſion annexed thereunto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>And who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of juſtified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons?</hi> He hath little reaſon to take your confeſſions, and daſh them in your teeth; ſince that was both the means
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40964:74"/> and evidence of pardon: But if you fear that, you may do as <hi>Hannah</hi> in Prayer, ſpeak in your hearts, and then Satan cannot tell what you ſay, but your God doth: However neglect not the duty; for this you may be ſure, that Satan will catch more advantage by omiſſion or negligent performance, than by an ingenuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of heart-ſins, though he do hear you.</p>
                  <p>Sirs, Awake to righteouſneſs, Rouze up your ſelves to the work, put not off God or conſcience with a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative anſwer: you may as well ſay, Nay, as pretend and promiſe to do it, and not perform; fall to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it therefore this day, there's danger in delays, if you do it not to day, you'l be more unfit to morrow: At this inſtant, fall upon thy knees, beg a bleſſing upon this book for the good of thy ſoul and others, look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Cloſet-Prayer as thy priviledge, as well as thy duty? 'Tis a mercy thou mayſt go to God as often as thou wilt, and for what thou needeſt: 'Tis no ſmall favour that God hath allowed thee the uſe of this privy Key to open Heaven-gates when thou haſt not the more publick key of others help in Prayer; yet this is thy incouragement, <hi>Thy Father that ſees in ſecret will reward thee openly.</hi>
                  </p>
